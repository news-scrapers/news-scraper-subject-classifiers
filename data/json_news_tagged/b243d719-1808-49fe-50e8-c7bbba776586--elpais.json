But in just over a month, it has raised \u20ac7,200 from 148 sponsors whose donations are being rewarded with a wide range of prizes, including a day for two in the village to experience the ins and outs of livestock farming, a workshop on milking sheep, another on making artisan cheese, and a lunch of torr\u00e0, a traditional Valencian dish of barbecued organic lamb.\nBesides his work as a shepherd, Jordi Benages is also one of the main partners in the family cheese farm, Queser\u00eda La Planeta, which started in 2013 with a herd of dairy Lacaune sheep at the foot of the Cate and Anroig mountains in the district of Baix Maestrat in Castell\u00f3n. \u201cWe work organically and sustainably and at a rhythm that respects the life cycle of the animals and the seasons of the year,\u201d says Benages, who aims to continue to produce organic cheese, \u201cbut in a more ecological way, by installing solar power for green energy.\u201d\nThe crowd-funding platform Lateuaterra has managed to raise \u20ac38,850 for various projects over the past two years, 90% of which have been successful. As far as the Benages family is concerned, the solar panels mean they can bring down energy costs without jeopardizing the standard sanitary requirements. \u201cWe also want to be in control of all the links in the food-production chain, from the animal feed to the sale of the product,\u201d says Benages, adding that the cheese should have a flavor and aroma specific to the area and allow for direct interaction between the producer and the consumer.\nBenages argues that small-scale family farming is necessary for sustainable land management and says the importance of the traditional role of shepherd should not be underestimated. \u201cShepherding and livestock farming help to prevent fires and guarantee the biodiversity of the land,\u201d he says.\nWithin 39 days, the crowdfunding project raised \u20ac7,200\nOne of the aims of the crowdfunding initiative is to encourage young people to become interested in farming. \u201cIt is profitable work that brings more pleasure than sacrifices,\u201d says Benages, who is keen to demonstrate that rural life and entrepreneurship are not mutually exclusive and can in fact provide a solution to Spain\u2019s depopulation problem.\nLa Planeta farm is taking on the challenge. Not only does the family project include livestock and cheese making, it also grows olives and almonds that have been registered by the Ecological Agricultural Committee of the Valencia region. \u201cAll our work and special features have resulted in a completely artisanal cheese, that naturally uses resources and respects the wisdom of our ancestors,\u201d says Benages.\nFrom now on, La Planeta cheese will not only draw on past wisdom but also on solar power, reducing its mark on the planet to its pungent flavor.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/20/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
