No one told us anything\u201d\n\nMany passengers on board the British Airways flight that was forced to make an emergency landing in Valencia on Monday have complained on social media and to the press about the lack of action and information from the airline. The plane encountered problems as it was trying to land when smoke filled the cabin due to an alleged fault in one of the plane\u2019s engines.\nThere was smoke everywhere and a very strong smell of\u00a0 burning metal\nBritish Airways passenger Mathew Haller\nThe passengers said they were surprised oxygen marks did not drop down given the amount of smoke, which even affected visibility in the cabin, as seen in various videos. Three people were taken to hospital for smoke inhalation, while others suffered minor scratches and bumps from the falls, as well as anxiety attacks. The Airbus A321 was carrying 175 passengers, including one baby.\n\u201cThe flight was normal until they told us that there was 15 minutes to landing,\u201d Mathew Haller, a 19-year-old from London, tells EL PA\u00cdS in a phone interview. \u201cFive minutes later we saw smoke coming out, more and more of it. There was smoke everywhere and a very strong smell of burning metal. I thought it was a terrorist attack. No one told us anything. And the oxygen masks also didn\u2019t drop down. There were people hitting above the compartment above them to see if they would drop down. But they didn\u2019t. The flight attendants had them however,\u201d he adds, explaining he was traveling to Valencia to spend the holidays with his family in Calpe.\nThe flight left London at 3:15pm and landed around 6:45pm.\n\u201cThere was an increasing amount of smoke and when we landed we couldn\u2019t see anything. We heard a very loud noise as if they were inflating the floats and emergency slide. We got up very quickly. I was in the last row. Next to me, there was a man with a bottle and he told us we should wet his shirt so we could breathe better. He was the only person helping people go down the slide and calming us down. I get to the exit and suddenly the only thing I see is an open chute and a flight attendant yelling at us to \u2018jump, jump.\u2019\nIt is not standard protocol to use oxygen masks when there is smoke in a cabin at low altitude\nBritish Airways\n\u201cAnd we come out in the middle of the runway, with people crying, and in shock. There were children and I saw one father who was very worried because he was not able to get out with his children. People were asking what happened. No one told us anything. No one calmed us down. Only the man without a shirt. Not the Civil Guard. Later we saw firefighters in the plane,\u201d he says.\nOn Tuesday, EL PA\u00cdS asked British Airways about the protocol in such cases why the oxygen masks were not deployed. The airline replied that \u201coxygen masks are only used in situations of cabin decompression. It is not standard protocol to use them when there is smoke in a cabin at low altitude.\u201d There was no mention of why the flight attendants were wearing oxygen masks.\nAfter the incident, British Airways said in a statement: \u201cFlight BA422 from Heathrow to Valencia experienced a technical issue on its landing approach into Valencia. All our customers were evacuated safely by our crew and met by the airport\u2019s emergency services.\n\u201cThere were 175 customers on board the flight, with six cabin crew and two pilots. Three customers were taken to hospital as a precaution and have since been discharged. The safety of our customers and crew is always our highest priority. In addition to our team on site, other British Airways team members have arrived in Valencia to help our customers and our local airport partners with anything they need.\u201d\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/07/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
