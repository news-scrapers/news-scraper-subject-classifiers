But at the end of June, the NGO ignored the ban and sailed to the zone to help rescue migrants at sea. On Thursday, the Open Arms crew rescued 53 people and two babies from a small boat, and later that night saved 69 other migrants from the sea. Two heavily pregnant women were evacuated from the ship on Saturday.\nThe Socialist (PSOE) government, which welcomed 400 migrants on board the Open Arms into the country last year, has refused to give the ship a safe port to dock. \u201cWe hope they are acting in accordance with international conventions and national regulations,\u201d said acting government spokesperson Isabel Cela\u00e1 on Friday. The Open Arms has also been denied entry by authorities in Malta and Italy, which have introduced strict closed-port policies to rescue ships.\nBut the mayor of Valencia, Joan Rib\u00f3, has said he will ask the Spanish government for permission to allow the boat to dock in the city. According to the mayor, Valencia \u201cis a welcoming, open city with an ethical and humane duty to the people who risk their lives fleeing from terror, war and misery,\u201d municipal sources told Spanish news agency EFE.\nRib\u00f3 made the offer after getting the approval of the premier of Valencia, Ximo Puig, of the PSOE, who said the region is willing to welcome Open Arms \u201cif the ship does not find a closer or more appropriate port.\u201d\nCatalan premier Quim Torra also offered the region\u2019s ports to the Open Arms on Friday, while Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau said the ship was welcome in the Catalan capital. The regional government of Extremadura said it is willing to take in 10 of the migrants.\nIn June 17, 2018, 630 migrants who were rescued by the humanitarian ship Aquarius were brought to the port of Valencia, after the Spanish government agreed to offer the boat a safe port to avert a humanitarian crisis.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/05/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
