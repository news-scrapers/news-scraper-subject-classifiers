In just two decades, 250 million people will suffer from water scarcity due to the droughts.\nThe report is being presented at a meeting of the Union for the Mediterranean, an international organization whose members include EU states as well as countries of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean.\nSince 2015, a group of over 80 scientists working under Cramer\u2019s guidance has been working on a study that is being touted as \u201cthe first-ever comprehensive scientific report on the impact of climate and environmental change in the Mediterranean region.\u201d\n\u201cNever before had there been such as complete synthesis as this,\u201d says Cramer about a document that is filled with alarming information. The project coordinator notes that many people are in a vulnerable situation because \u201cthey live very close to the sea and also because they are poor and have few options for protecting themselves or moving away.\u201d The report warns that in future there will be longer and more intense heatwaves, as well as more frequent periods of drought.\nDespite the pessimistic outlook (see bottom box for report highlights), Cramer underscores that the goal of the study is to \u201cprovide balanced information about the risks for the entire Mediterranean basin\u201d to politicians and their advisors. The scientist also makes a call for action: \u201cThe North needs to help the South to adapt, to guarantee stability for the economies of southern countries. Every ton of CO2 that is reduced makes a difference.\u201d\nGrammenos Mastrojeni, the deputy secretary general for Energy and Climate Action at the Union for the Mediterranean, believes that this report can be useful to government leaders when they need to make policy decisions.\n\u201cWe are not used to incorporating climate and nature into our policies and our planning. But if we don\u2019t, we will be the victims of a very strong dynamic that will change the foundations of the interests on which we have built the balance of the Mediterranean,\u201d he says in a telephone conversation.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t plan for this, it could become a very important destabilization factor. But if we manage to incorporate it into our policies, it could transform into an opportunity to improve our cooperation and achieve progress that is fair, lasting and equitable in the entire region,\u201d he adds.\nMastrojeni says that poor populations, those who are forced to move when climate conditions such as drought imperil their livelihood, are more at risk of falling prey to human smugglers or terrorist groups. \u201cThis is not happening in the [Mediterranean] region yet, but it is in the area around Lake Chad, where [terrorist organization] Boko Haram is gaining many followers due to the collapse of the ecosystem, which provides no more living opportunities.\nThis expert believes that political leaders are aware of the challenge. \u201cGovernments are at a much more advanced stage than the public thinks, but the problem is that there are no magic solutions, yet everything is happening at a tremendous speed and we need to adapt everything. Science gives us an idea of what could happen, but the question is how to incorporate this data into political action and democratic decision-making.\u201d\nSea level. Of all the climate change effects examined in the report, Cramer underscores the rising sea level. By 2100 the waters of the Mediterranean will swell over a meter, which confirms the most pessimistic global scenario envisioned by the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This will affect a third of the population living on the Mediterranean coast: in North Africa alone, the livelihood of at least 37 million people is at risk. And Cramer adds another problem to the flood damage: increasingly salty land currently used for agriculture in the deltas and estuaries of the rivers Nile, Ebro, Rh\u00f4ne and Po.\nFreshwater. The other major effect worrying Cramer is the increasing frequency of heatwaves, something that Spain will particularly suffer from. Since 1950 droughts have been increasingly frequent, and the report notes that even if global warming is kept under 2\u00baC, as set in the Paris Agreement, the populations living near river basins in the Near and Middle East will be exposed to severe water shortages. The study says that freshwater reserves could drop by 15% in the coming decades in the whole of the Mediterranean, and that this will have a serious impact on agriculture. By 2040, around 250 million people will suffer from water scarcity, having less than 1,000 cubic meters per person a year. This situation could lead to increased conflict and mass migration, warn the scientists.\nHealth and food safety. The scientific team also lists several health risks associated with climate change in the Mediterranean, including a rise in heat-related deaths and disease, particularly in the cities and among vulnerable groups. There will be a deterioration of the quality of the air, land and water due to pollution, and this in turn will cause greater respiratory and cardiovascular problems.\nExperts also warn that food safety could be negatively affected by lower crop yields and diminishing fish populations. \u201cAround 90% of commercial fish stocks are already over-exploited in the Mediterranean,\u201d says the report. \u201cAnd the average weight of fish is expected to drop by as much as 49% by 2050.\u201d\nLoss of ecosystems. Many ecosystems are under threat from climate change, the change in land use, pollution and over-exploitation, says the report. For instance, ocean acidification \u2013 when seawater absorbs carbon dioxide from human emissions, lowering its pH \u2013 and rising seawater temperatures \u201chave already caused the loss of 41% of the main predators including marine mammals.\u201d Some of the effects that are visible today include the proliferation of jellyfish in the sea and Asian tiger mosquitoes on land. Scientists also believe there will be more \u201cmega-wildfires\u201d and that burnt areas could grow by as much as 40%, even in the most optimistic scenario of a 1.5\u00baC temperature increase above pre-industrial levels.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/10/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
