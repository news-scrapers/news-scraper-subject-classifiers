The country has fallen from 25th to 27th place on the Good Governance Index, compiled by the MESIAS project with support from Espa\u00f1a Global (or Global Spain), a state agency working to monitor and improve the country\u2019s image abroad.\nThe index ranks countries in six different areas: control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and voice and accountability. Spain fell in all parameters from 2016 to 2017 except for rule of law, where it moved up one place to 26th spot. But the most pronounced fall was in the area of political stability, where Spain fell from 33rd to 40th position on the list of 145 countries.\nThe study is based on World Bank data from 2017, which is the latest year available, and does not take into account the recent failed investiture bid of acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez of the Socialist Party, or his successful no-confidence motion of June 2018.\nAccording to Jos\u00e9 Maria Cubillo, a doctor in economic and business studies at the Autonomous University of Madrid and the leader of the MESIAS project, the drop can be attributed to the crisis in Catalonia, where an independence movement has divided the region, and to the repeat elections in 2016. \u201cWhat\u2019s worrying is that Spain has fallen in five of the six parameters that are measured, and more importantly, there is a continual drop in good governance since the index began 12 years ago,\u201d he explains. In 2005, Spain came in 20th place on the world ranking but today it is ranked 27th. In control of corruption, the country has fallen from 18th position to 32nd, and in government efficiency, it is ranked 23rd, down from 17th.\n\u201cSpain is still a world leader when it comes to good governance, within the first quartile [of the list], but it continues to follow a downward trend, and if this path continues, it could fall behind its EU neighbors,\u201d warns Cubillo.\nAccording to the study, New Zealand has the best government in the world. Five EU countries (Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany) are in the top five, and another 13 are within the top 20.\nCubillo believes the seven-point drop in political stability reflects \u201ca certain dissatisfaction\u201d of Spaniards towards the political class. \u201cWhat the data tells us is that there is a feeling that things are not going well. Instability causes uncertainty and inhibits people when it comes time to make long-term decisions,\u201d he explains.\nSpaniards\u2019 opinion of their government\u2019s ability to control corruption has dropped in recent years, reaching its worst point in 2017 with the trial in the so-called G\u00fcrtel case, the largest probe into political corruption in Spain\u2019s democratic history. Confidence in government effectiveness and regulatory quality have also steadily fallen.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "07/30/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
