We will do so the only way we know how: democratically and peacefully.\u201d\nWe will advance toward the Catalan republic the only way we know how: democratically and peacefully\nCatalan premier Quim Torra\nAlso on Tuesday, other independence leaders \u2013 representatives from parties Together for Catalunya (JxC), the Republican Catalan Left (ERC) and the far-left CUP, as well as civil societies ANC and \u00d2mnium Cultural \u2013 read out a manifesto calling for a \u201cmassive response based on non-violent struggle and civil disobedience\u201d to the upcoming ruling by the Supreme Court on the fate of 12 leaders who led the illegal breakaway attempt of 2017. The independence movement widely expects these leaders to be found guilty of rebellion, a crime that entails long prison terms.\n\u201cWe will consider any sentence that does not acquit [the defendants] to be unjust,\u201d the manifesto stated, adding that the October 1 referendum was the \u201cbiggest act of sovereignty in the recent history of Catalonia and in Europe in the last few years.\u201d The sentence, the text continued, will be \u201cthe biggest attack against our fundamental rights,\u201d calling the accusation of sedition and rebellion that the public prosecutor leveled against the pro-independence leaders \u201cfalse.\u201d\nEL PA\u00cdS\nEx-Catalan premier Carles Puigdemont made a public appearance on Tuesday in Brussels, where he demanded the right to take up his seat in the European Parliament. \u201cTwo years ago now, we voted in an independence referendum in Catalonia. They tell us our votes do not count. That is intolerable. The European Parliament has started working without considering more than two million citizens who are not represented. We trust that democracy will prevail in the end,\u201d he said, alluding to the European Union elections of May, when his Together for Catalonia party earned two seats.\nBut taking up the position entailed first traveling to Madrid to pick up his official credentials, a move that would have gotten him arrested to face the same charges as his colleagues who stayed behind and were tried for rebellion at the Supreme Court.\nJordi Ca\u00f1as, a member of the European Parliament for Ciudadanos (Citizens), a non-separatist party born in Catalonia, said that the fact that Puigdemont is not in prison is \u201ca problem for European democracy.\u201d\n\u201cTwo years ago, some tried to violate Spanish democracy with an illegal referendum [...] without caring about the consequences. Some people are now paying the consequences, and some are not.\u201d\nLast week, Catalan regional premier Quim Torra publicly defended nine individuals who were arrested on suspicion of preparing violent acts on or around the anniversary of the referendum. The suspects have been charged with terrorism offenses after the police seized bomb-making material and instructions on how to make explosives, according to the investigation. Torra said last week that there is an attempt \u201cto create a phony narrative of violence in Catalonia.\u201d\n\u201cWe pledge to persist until we achieve freedom for the political prisoners and the return of exiled individuals,\u201d said Torra, alluding to the tried secession leaders and to his own predecessor Carles Puigdemont, who fled Spain to avoid arrest and now lives in Belgium [see side box].\n\u201cThe regional government asserts that the spirit of that day [October 1, 2017] and the days that followed, especially October 3 [when there were street demonstrations to protest both the police charges against referendum voters and King Felipe VI\u2019s subsequent address to the nation], is the spirit with which we must face the challenges of the future, especially along this path to the Catalan republic, which will be inevitable and which we want to build with everyone,\u201d said Aragon\u00e8s.\nTorra had words of sympathy for the citizens who were hurt during the police charges that took place that day in a bid to stop a vote that had been declared unconstitutional by Spain\u2019s highest court. He said that \u201c2.3 million citizens went out to vote and defended the ballot boxes. Catalan society, as a repository of civil and political rights, defended them despite the consequences, despite being beaten and assaulted by forces sent in by the Spanish state.\u201d\nAn opinion poll published this May by the regional government\u2019s Opinion Studies Center (CEO) found that 48.6% of respondents rejected secession from Spain, compared to 44.1% in March.\nLater on Tuesday, thousands of people \u2013 18,000 according to the local police \u2013 took to the streets in Barcelona on a march to commemorate the second anniversary of the referendum on independence. Just before 10pm, the protestors cut off the Gran Via in the Catalan capital.\nThe organizers were not expecting huge crowds to attend last night, but rather a series of pro-independence marches in the streets of Catalan municipalities such as Girona, Tarragona, Lleida and Sabadell. \u201cIt will be decentralized, like the vote was two years ago,\u201d said last night Montserrat Tudela, a member of the permanent secretariat of the ANC pro-independence civic group.\nBanners carried by protestors last night showed messages such as \u201cWe will do it again,\u201d in reference to the referendum, and \u201cOctober 1, no forgetting or forgiving.\u201d\nCarlos E. Cu\u00e9, Madrid\nSpain\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, made clear on Tuesday that the central government could once again suspend Catalonia\u2019s regional powers under Article 155 of the Constitution, and that his administration has been studying the possibility of doing so.\nThe previous Popular Party government led by then-Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy used Article 155 in the wake of the 2017 independence drive in the northeastern Spanish region, which saw an outlawed referendum on secession take place on October 1 of that year, and a subsequent unilateral declaration of independence passed through the Catalan regional government on October 27.\nSpeaking to the Cadena SER radio network on Tuesday morning, S\u00e1nchez, of the Socialist Party (PSOE), said that there was no issue with the application of Article 155, despite the fact that parliament has been dissolved ahead of a fresh general election on November 10. \u201cA caretaker government has greatly diminished powers, but [Article] 155 can be applied without problems, we have studied this and there would be no problems in terms of the Constitution or its legitimacy [...],\u201d he said.\nS\u00e1nchez added that the central government is prepared to appeal any decisions taken by the Catalan regional government that it considers to be unconstitutional, as it has done up to now. He also called on separatist leaders in Catalonia \u201cnot to play with fire.\u201d\nThe caretaker prime minister\u2019s interview with Cadena SER took place not only on the second anniversary of the illegal independence referendum, but also just days before the Supreme Court is due to release its ruling in the trial of the pro-independence leaders accused of committing offenses during the 2017 secessionist drive.\nAdditional reporting by Marta Rodr\u00edguez, Alfonso L.
