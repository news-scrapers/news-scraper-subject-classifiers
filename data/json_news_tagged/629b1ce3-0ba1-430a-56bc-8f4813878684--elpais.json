This means that nearly two-thirds (64%) of the 180,000 Spaniards living in the UK, according to Spanish Foreign Ministry estimates, have applied to legalize their status.\nOur offer and the Spanish offer are not symmetrical because they are different systems\nBritish Embassy spokeswoman\nThe high figure was recorded in September, the month before the official (though not necessarily definitive) Brexit deadline of October 31. \u201cWe want Spaniards who are living in my country to remain there,\u201d said Hugh Elliott, the new British ambassador in Spain, in a statement. The Spanish embassy in London is also conducting an awareness campaign to ensure Spaniards living there understand the importance of registering.\nThe Spanish government has informed London that it does not feel that Spaniards in the UK are being offered the same guarantees as Britons in Spain, which is home to the largest British community outside the UK.\nMadrid has drafted a decree that leaves nearly intact the rights of the approximately 370,000 British nationals living in Spain. But the application of this decree depends on reciprocity from London, Spanish authorities have warned.\nRepresentatives from the foreign departments of both countries met last week to discuss the matter further. \u201cThe meeting was positive, but not conclusive: we have requested further explanations about the British system,\u201d said sources familiar with the meeting.\nThe meeting was positive, but not conclusive\nSpanish foreign affairs official\nThe British model, which grants \u201cpre-settled\u201d and \u201csettled\u201d status to EU residents depending on the number of years they have been living in the UK, lets them work, study and have access to public healthcare. But Spanish authorities are worried about the legal force of this British mechanism. In Spain, the government decree regulating Britons\u2019 rights will have the force of law once it goes into effect. The British system is a general scheme for all EU residents.\n\u201cOur offer and the Spanish offer are not symmetrical because they are different systems, but we feel that it reciprocates the generous Spanish offer,\u201d said a spokesperson from the British embassy in Madrid.\nDespite all the preliminary work, several elements will inevitably be left for the last minute, if and when\u00a0a no-deal Brexit is no longer avoidable. The main challenges will then be guaranteeing equal access to healthcare and maintaining pension rights.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/11/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
