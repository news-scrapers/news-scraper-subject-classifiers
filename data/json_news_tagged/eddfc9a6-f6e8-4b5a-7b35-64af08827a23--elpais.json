That\u2019s 41% more than it was in 2007.\nThe data, published early this month by the European Union\u2019s statistics office, Eurostat, is an example of how the 2008 financial crisis consolidated regional inequality within the bloc, with wealth increasingly concentrated in Europe\u2019s biggest capitals. Spain does not fare well: only five of its regions have GDP per capita above the European average.\nThis is a result of the crisis and more importantly the impact of the austerity measures\nIgnacio Molina, researcher at the Elcano Royal Institute\nNow the specter of a new recession has materialized before Europe has managed to heal the scars of its last crisis. According to Eurostat\u2019s last annual report, which was published on Monday, EU\u2019s big capital cities and their metropolitan areas have accumulated the greatest wealth over the past few years. Meanwhile, the majority of EU regions have GDP per capita that is equal to or less than the EU average of \u20ac30,900. That was the case for 59% of regions in 2007 and 62% in 2017.\nIn other words, the economic recovery has neither reduced the gap between EU member states nor the inequalities existing within each state.\nSpain is no exception. There is a stark difference in wealth between the country\u2019s capitals and its rural and post-industrial regions. Along with France, it is one of the countries whose regions fell furthest behind the rest of Europe between 2007 and 2017, according to the European Parliamentary Research Services (EPRS), the European Parliament\u2019s think tank.\nAccording to Eurostat, in only five Spanish regions \u2013 Madrid, Basque Country, Navarre, Catalonia and Arag\u00f3n \u2013 was GDP per capita in 2017 above the European average. At the other end of the spectrum, in Extremadura, the exclave cities of Melilla and Ceuta in North Africa, and the Canary Islands, it was between 64% and 75% of the EU\u2019s average.\nAlthough per capita income has increased in almost all of Spain\u2019s regions in the last 10 years, bouncing back to pre-crisis levels, all have lost ground against the EU average.\n\u201cThe crisis has increased the income gap between regions,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Montalvo, a professor at Pompeu Fabra University. \u201cIt has hit some sectors worse than others, but redistribution mechanisms have also produced uneven results.\u201d\nGarc\u00eda Montalvo believes that Europe\u2019s Cohesion Policy, designed to limit inequality, has not been enough to curb natural disparity. The budget for the EU\u2019s Cohesion Policy, amounting to 1.3% of its GDP from 2021-2027, is now under discussion in Brussels.\nThe OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) has already made it clear in one of its latest reports that regions with extensive international exposure experience the fastest growth. Large capitals attracting a disproportionate amount of foreign capital, for example, are far wealthier than cities with scarce foreign investment.\n\u201cIt is a general trend,\u201d says Ignacio Molina, a researcher at the Elcano Royal Institute. \u201cThere would have been wealth concentration without the crisis, but the tendency has intensified and the crisis has exacerbated the effect.\u201d\nIn 2017, West London recorded an average GDP per capita of \u20ac188,000, almost six times more than the European average, making it the richest area in Europe. Luxembourg came in a distant second with an average GDP per capita of \u20ac75,900 euros. And at the other end of the spectrum was Severozapaden in Bulgaria.\nThe recovery has neither reduced the gap between EU member states nor inequalities within each state\nAccording to an article from independent think tank Center for European Reform, the most productive regions are no longer those that are highly industrialized. Being located close to a thriving city or one with a high percentage of young professional workers is also a significant factor.\nThis trend where wealth is concentrated in the big capitals, defined by Eurostat as \u201cmonocentric,\u201d is also prevalent in Eastern Europe: Prague, Bratislava and Bucharest all have GDPs per capita well above the European average while the rest of the country lags far behind. Italy and Germany are the only two exceptions to this rule.\n\u201cThe crisis has not affected aggregate wealth so much as its distribution,\u201d adds Molina. \u201cThis is a result of the crisis and more importantly the impact of the austerity measures.\u201d\nAs evidence starts to trickle in of an economic downturn, the challenge now is to decide where to invest. \u201cShould the EU focus on engines of economic growth or on regions in decline?\u201d asks Molina, who warns that always backing the same places could have more than economic consequences. \u201cIt\u2019s about deserted Spain and the yellow vest protests in France,\u201d he explains.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/18/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
