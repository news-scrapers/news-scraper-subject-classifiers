According to official sources, the number of migrants who tried to cross into Spanish territory was even higher, but only around 150 made it past the double fence, which is six meters high, 8.4 kilometers long and topped with concertina wire.\n\nA total of 11 Civil Guard officers were injured in the incident, according to the latest available figures from national health authorities, while dozens of migrants hurt themselves going over the barbed wire.\nThe rush on the fence \u201cwas conducted in a violent manner, with hand-to-hand confrontations [with officers] and using hooks, sticks and acid,\u201d said the Civil Guard union AUGC in a statement that underscored the shortage of law enforcement resources. \u201cThis latest organized assault newly evidences the need for technical and human reinforcements in border cities, as AUGC has been demanding for years.\u201d\nThe union also urged acting interior minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska to establish \u201ca clear and unequivocal protocol of action on the borders of Ceuta and Melilla\u201d and \u201cto take a stand on pushback policy. It is urgent for officers to be afforded greater legal protection in the daily job they do at border crossings.\u201d\nSeveral migrants became caught up in the concertina wire as they tried to cross into Ceuta but were able to untangle themselves and to jump over the fence. According to the local daily El faro de Ceuta, seven of them remained stuck and began yelling \u201cSpain, Spain!\u201d and \u201cFriend, friend!\u201d while others begged the Civil Guard officers to let them pass.\nActing Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said on Monday that the Spanish government plans to remove the concertina wire on top of the border fences dividing Spain\u2019s North African exclave cities of Ceuta and Melilla from Morocco in 2020. \u201cWe have to have more secure borders, but without concertina,\u201d he said in a television interview with Telecinco.\nThe migrants made the jump into Spain from the Benz\u00fa pier, then ran at full speed to the city\u2019s temporary migrant reception center (CETI), four kilometers away. The CETI in Ceuta is typically the first destination for migrants who jump the border fence separating Spain from Morocco. Government officials said that with these 150 newcomers, the capacity of the migrant center has been exceeded again (occupation until today was slightly under the maximum of 512).\nThe last time migrants jumped the fence into Ceuta on such a scale was in August 2018. On that occasion, the crossing was larger and more violent, with 602 migrants from a group of 850 making it into Spanish territory. The migrants used homemade blow torches, quicklime, sticks and sharp objects to get past officers. Several people were arrested and accused of criminal organization. The violent border crossing left 132 injured and 32 guards with bruises, burns and respiratory problems.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/30/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
