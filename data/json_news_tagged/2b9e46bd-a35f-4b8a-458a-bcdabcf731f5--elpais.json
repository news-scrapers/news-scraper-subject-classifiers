The company accidentally sold\u00a0a strong vasodilator, which is most commonly used to treat alopecia, or hair loss, as omeprazole, a drug used to treat heartburn and acid reflux.\nMy son\u2019s forehead, cheeks, arms and legs, hands became covered in hair\nMother \u00c1ngela Selles\nHypertrichosis is also known as \u201cwerewolf syndrome\u201d because it is characterized by an abnormal amount of hair growth over the body. The AEMPS, which works under the Health Ministry, was notified of a new case on Tuesday, which was diagnosed in the province of Granada in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia. In total, 10 babies have been affected in Cantabria, four in Andalusia and three in Valencia.\n\u201cMy son\u2019s forehead, cheeks, arms and legs, hands became covered in hair \u2026 He had the eyebrows of an adult. It was very scary because we didn\u2019t know what was happening to him,\u201d said \u00c1ngela Selles, a mother from Granada, whose son Uriel was six months old when his body started to change.\nAnother mother from Granada, who preferred not to give her name, remembers the \u201canguish of going from one doctor to another\u201d when her three-month-old son began to suffer from the same problem. \u201cWe went to the pediatrician and they told us it could be something genetic or to do with his metabolism. We had to start going to specialists to rule out several syndromes and rare conditions,\u201d she said.\nWhen doctors notified the Spanish System of Pharmacovigilance of Medicine for Human Use (SEFV-H) of the first cases of hypertrichosis in babies, AEMPS opened an investigation. The agency focused on syrups for acid reflux, which are prepared as compound pharmaceuticals \u2013 individualized medications or treatments prepared by a pharmacist for a specific person \u2013 that some pharmacies had sold to the parents. This led AEMPS to a factory called Farma-Qu\u00edmica Sur in M\u00e1laga, in the south of Spain, where they then sent inspectors.\n\u201cThe original shipment of bulk omeprazole from India was analyzed and the results showed that it was in perfect condition. The problem was when it was divided into small batches that were later also sold in bulk. There was a serious confusion in the process. It\u2019s not that omeprazole was mixed with minoxidil [a medication to treat male-pattern hair loss], but rather that the package leaflet said one thing and the pharmacy another,\u201d sources from AEMPS told EL PA\u00cdS.\nThe agency issued its first warning on July 11, which was directed at just one of the batches of omeprazole that Farma-Qu\u00edmica Sur had put on the market. The factory was closed on Tuesday for failing to meet \u201ccontrol standards on drug production,\u201d according to AEMPS sources.\nThe case against Farm-Qu\u00edmica Sur \u201cremains open,\u201d and the company has six months to present AEMPS with a plan to rectify the problems identified by the agency in its \u201cdeficiency report.\u201d This deadline can be pushed back or brought forward, if the company decides to present its plan earlier. If the AEMPS inspectors are convinced by the plan, Farma-Qu\u00edmica Sur can resume operations. If they are not, the company will have its authorization to produce pharmaceutical products revoked.\nHypertrichosis is known as werewolf syndrome because it is characterized by an abnormal amount of hair growth\u00a0\nThe families affected by the outbreak told EL PA\u00cdS they are indignant about what has happened to them. \u201cMy son had drunk two and half bottles [of the syrup], before the doctor warned me,\u201d said Selles. \u201cThey have done several tests and for now the liver is the only thing that is not great, but they have told us that it is not serious and that it will regenerate,\u201d she added.\n\u201cMy son drank two vials of medicine, all the tests have come back fine, although we still have to go to the cardiologist in September,\u201d said the second mother from Granada. Although the hair on the babies has started to fall off, both mothers regret that it is happening \u201clittle by little, the doctors told me it will take months to disappear.\u201d\nAll doctors and pharmacists consulted by EL PA\u00cdS said that there \u201cis no precedent published in scientific literature of children so young who have taken such quantities of minoxidil,\u201d a drug whose most serious side effect is heart problems. The outbreak, considered a \u201csentinel event,\u201d will now be investigated to gain a better understanding of the health impact of minoxidil on babies.\nThe public prosecutor of Cantabria also opened a case against Farma-Qu\u00edmica Sur in August after four families launched criminal proceedings against the company.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/28/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
