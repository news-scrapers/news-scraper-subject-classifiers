Casqueiro / C. Huete\nMeanwhile, a senior official of the Popular Party (PP) has suggested a grand coalition between themselves and the PSOE to prevent a new parliamentary election. \u201cS\u00e1nchez should talk with the rest of the chamber and tell the PP: \u2018I propose a governing coalition, a grand coalition in our country because I don\u2019t trust Podemos\u2019,\u201d said Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the regional premier of Galicia, in statements made on the radio network Onda Cero.\nBut this position clashes with the official stance taken by PP president Pablo Casado, who has been forging a loose alliance named \u201cEspa\u00f1a Suma\u201d with the center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) and the far-right Vox.\nIglesias offered to stay together until mid-2020, after which the PSOE could end the relationship if it felt it was not working. Even then, Unidas Podemos would continue to support S\u00e1nchez throughout the rest of the political term.\nBut S\u00e1nchez, who is seeking to head a minority government with external support, rejected the offer. The Socialist leader won the most votes in April but fell well short of the majority he needs to form a government. Cross-party talks have failed to produce the required numbers, and when S\u00e1nchez stood in an investiture vote in July he failed to attract enough support. If a solution is not found by September 23, parliament will be dissolved and a new election called \u2013 the fourth in as many years, reflecting Spain\u2019s fractured political scene.\n\u201cAfter the failed investiture and the rejection by Unidas Podemos\u2019 leader of the coalition that had been offered by the PSOE, the conditions are not there either in terms of minimum trust or a plan for a cohesive, coherent government working in a single direction within a stable political term, which is something that Spain urgently needs,\u201d said PSOE sources to justify their leader\u2019s rejection of Podemos\u2019 latest overtures.\nThe Socialists say that Unidas Podemos should forget about the coalition and negotiate a few positions in non-ministerial agencies.\nThere are five days left before Iglesias and S\u00e1nchez are scheduled to meet with King Felipe VI as part of the formalities to determine whether a candidate stands any chance of forming a government or whether parliament must be dissolved.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/13/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
