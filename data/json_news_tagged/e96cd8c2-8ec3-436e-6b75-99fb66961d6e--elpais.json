They have also made a barricade with construction material in the opposite direction into France. Both protests are on French territory.\nThe Catalan association for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and self-employed road haulers (AGTC) estimates that the protest will cost each vehicle \u20ac55 for every hour the driver is stuck. \u201cEvery day there are unplanned roadblocks and no notice is given, which makes it impossible for hauliers to avoid them,\u201d explained Carlos Folchi, the AGTC general secretary.\nThe action has been called by Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic, a movement with no visible leaders that has been coordinating protests in Catalonia in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling that sentenced nine pro-independence leaders to jail terms.\nAt around 9am on Monday, the group sent their followers a message via\u00a0Twitter and the instant-messaging service Telegram asking them to gather at the AP-7 border crossing. Many police officers have been sent to the area.\nTsunami Democr\u00e0tic has called the protest their \u201cmost ambitious action,\u201d and promised more protests if a political solution is not found for the crisis in Catalonia. The group is calling for the \u201cright to self-determination, freedom for the prisoners, exiles and reprisal victims [in reference to the Catalan separatists in jail or in self-imposed exile for their role in the 2017 breakaway bid] and the free pursuit of basic rights.\u201d\nTsunami Democr\u00e0tic explained in a statement that the aim of the roadblock is to make the international community \u201cunderstand\u201d that the only solution to the crisis in Catalonia is to \u201csit down and talk.\u201d Failing to do so will only further isolate the breakaway region, they maintain. According to the statement, the roadblock near the French border is meant to symbolize this isolation.\nMembers of #Catalan protest group #Tsunamidemocratic are blocking the AP-7 highway in #LaJonquera, on the French-Spanish border. They seem to be here to stay: a stage is being built in the middle of the road. pic.twitter.com/DpLIHyKDnB\nIn a statement issued on Friday, the group said that the protest will last three days. \u201cAsk for at least one of these days off from work. You have to be available to go to different parts of the region, and if you can, spend the night outside,\u201d the group told supporters, adding that they would need to bring warm clothes, cellphone batteries, food, sleeping bags and tents, and to display a non-violent attitude.\n#TsunamiDemocratic new action: collapsing french border.pic.twitter.com/JoFSyNZqjj\nTsunami Democr\u00e0tic was activated on September 2 with the public support of the Catalan regional premier Quim Torra, his deputy premier Pere Aragon\u00e8s, and the speaker of the regional parliament, Roger Torrent. Its leaders are currently unknown, but police believe that it was conceived during a meeting in Switzerland between the former Catalan premier Carles Puigdemont, Torra, representatives of Catalan nationalist parties, and pro-independence civic associations ANC and \u00d2mnium Cultural.\nThe protest comes just one day after Spaniards returned to the polls for the fourth general election in as many years. The far-right party Vox, which campaigned heavily against the Catalan independence movement, made the biggest gains of the night, winning 52 seats in Spain\u2019s lower house, the Congress of Deputies.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/11/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
