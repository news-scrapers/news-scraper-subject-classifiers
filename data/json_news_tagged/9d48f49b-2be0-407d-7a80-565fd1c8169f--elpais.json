Some of the animals are unable to stand, yet pass through to the production chain, ready for consumption.\nAccording to images shared with this newspaper by the environmental association Equalia, these scenes are taking place inside C\u00e1rnicas Salvan\u00e9s S.L., a slaughterhouse located in Villarejo de Salvan\u00e9s, in the southeast of the Madrid region.\nThe images show that some animals are not stunned before being killed\nOn Monday, Equalia filed a criminal complaint against this business at a court in Legan\u00e9s, accusing its owners of violating European animal welfare law and finding inadequate sanitary conditions at the facilities. The company denies the accusations.\nThe footage begins with a drone-captured image that shows the location of the slaughterhouse in Villarejo de Salvan\u00e9s. At the family business, which is run by three brothers, lambs, sheep, goats and cows are slaughtered and subsequently put on the market for consumption in Madrid and parts of Toledo.\nUntil the beginning of 2019, the company held a Halal certificate, meaning that within the same slaughterhouse, animals are separated and depending on the final destination of the meat, they are either stunned or not (when the Islamic tradition is followed) before being slaughtered. Throughout this year, all animals should have been stunned to avoid unnecessary suffering.\nOne of them was hung while conscious for up to half-an-hour\nDavid Herrero, Equalia\nBut hidden cameras captured what was happening between June and early September. The images show that some animals are not stunned before being killed. In the video, a sheep is seen suffering an entire night without being slaughtered.\u00a0\n\u201cThe slaughterman shirks his duties, so that some lambs pass through production without their blood being properly drained and are hung up while still alive with the rest of the dead animals,\u201d explains David Herrero, general coordinator of Equalia, which has launched similar campaigns against slaughterhouses in Segovia and \u00c1vila. \u201cOne of them was hung while conscious for up to half-an-hour, at which point the image of the animal is lost. We don\u2019t know if it was skinned alive\nThe images show sheep that are ill or cannot stand on their legs, being taken to the conveyor belt to enter the bleeding area. One of them had been suffering for an entire night, the footage shows. \u201cIt was 10 hours before it was taken to the slaughter zone,\u201d says Herrero. The law states that an animal that cannot walk will not be transported to the place of slaughter, and will instead be slaughtered on the spot, without moving it or, evidently, throwing it.\nOther images show a worker attaching identity tags to several lambs inside the slaughterhouse. The regulations specify that all animals must already have this identification by the time they enter the enclosure, otherwise there is a risk of losing traceability.\n\u201cThat is impossible. It can\u2019t be. There are official veterinarians here. When animals enter the slaughterhouse, they have to come with their paperwork in order. If any are missing, they are processed through the Agriculture Ministry. And if any animal is not identified, it is thrown away, it is seized. Yesterday [Monday] there were two animals that didn\u2019t have an ear tag and they were thrown away [sic].\u201d explains Juli\u00e1n Rangel, manager of C\u00e1rnicas Salvan\u00e9s. \u201cIt all depends on the context. A few isolated images can be interpreted any way you like,\u201d he added, denying that his company fails to\u00a0 comply with animal welfare regulations or that sanitation conditions are deficient.\nIt all depends on the context. A few isolated images can be interpreted any way you like\nJuli\u00e1n Rangel, slaughterhouse manager\nIn addition to exposing violations, Equalia is conducting a\u00a0 campaign for \u201ca progressive implementation of CCTV in slaughterhouses\u201d in order to aid the proper enforcement of animal welfare and food safety regulations. \u201cWe ask for them to be installed wherever live animals are handled, and for the images to be stored for one month in strict compliance with data-protection legislation. Also, we ask that these images be reviewed by the same operator or by the food-safety service of the Madrid regional government.\u201d This system, Herrero assures, has already been implemented in places including England, Scotland and Israel.\nBeyond the installation of closed-circuit cameras, \u201cwhat is evident is that the legislation needs to be tightened,\u201d says\u00a0Laura Duarte, the new president of the animal-rights party Pacma. Duarte notes that thanks to the work of associations such as Equalia, it is at least possible to \u201cprove that all of this is really happening.\u201d\n\u201cStunning requires a minimum amount of time, but because the production chain goes so fast, most of the time the animals are fully conscious. The truth is that even the little legislation that does exist is not being complied with,\u201d she explains.\nMadrid regional officials hold that the compulsory installation of CCTV is a measure that must be taken \u201cat the national level.\u201d\n\u201cThe slaughterhouses in the Madrid region are under the control of the Official Veterinarians of the General Directorate of Public Health; there are daily inspections of the slaughtered animals, of the sanitary conditions at the facilities, and of the slaughtering process,\u201d explains a source at the Madrid Health Department.\nIn addition to the daily inspections, audits are also carried out to check the working procedures by slaughterhouse operators, who \u201cmust have a self-monitoring system in place based on hazard analysis and critical control points, including hygiene and animal welfare aspects.\u201d In C\u00e1rnicas Salnan\u00e9s, that audit was carried out in August.\nEnglish version by Alicia Kember.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/23/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
