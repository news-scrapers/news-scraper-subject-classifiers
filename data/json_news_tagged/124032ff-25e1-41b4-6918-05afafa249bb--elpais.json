Yet the same law protected a series of bull-related events celebrated at local fiestas in Catalonia, including bull runs known as correbous. Every year, around 450 events are held in Catalan cities, towns and villages that involve bulls. But an incident in Girona on Sunday, when a bull managed to get into the crowd at a mobile bullring, injuring 19 people, may force the local council to rethink such events.\nOne woman was left with serious injuries and had to have emergency surgery on Sunday night\nJordi Camps, the mayor of Vidreres, the village where the incident happened, insisted that the fiestas met with current regulations, despite the fact that the animal was able to leap over the fence and charge against a number of spectators. One woman was left with serious injuries and had to have emergency surgery on Sunday night. The bull was shot dead by local police officers.\nThe Vidreres council has issued a statement expressing regret over what happened, and has met with the company in charge of organizing the correbous to examine the incident. The council added that in the coming days it will decide whether to prohibit the event in the future, or whether the conditions for its celebration will be toughened up. The regional police force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, have opened an investigation to establish whether there was negligence on the part of the organizers. The regional Interior department has confirmed that the paperwork to authorize the activities involving bulls had been correctly processed and that there was no reason to reject the request.\nThe decision to protect fiestas such as correbous in Catalonia was taken by regional deputies from Catalan parties Converg\u00e8ncia and the Catalan Republican Left (ERC), as well as the conservative Popular Party (PP) in the region and the Catalan Socialist Party (PSC). They argued at the time that these fiestas, where the bull is the protagonist, are part of a tradition that should be respected because they form part of local culture in many parts of the region. The legislation stated that these fiestas have origins that go as far back as the 17th century, and that they became more widespread in the following two centuries. Paradoxically, it was the same law that expressly \u201cprohibited bullfighting.\u201d\nIn \u2018bou embolat,\u2019 a bull is immobilized so that flaming torches can be tied to its horns before letting it loose through the streets\nA total of 457 fiestas involving bulls took place in Catalonia last year, including what is known as bou embolat, when a bull is immobilized so that flaming torches can be tied to its horns before letting it loose through the streets, and the bou caplla\u00e7at, when the bull is dragged through the streets by ropes tied to its horns.\nMost of these events, 439 in total, were celebrated in 30 or so municipalities in Terres de l\u2019Ebre, in the south of the region, where a number of different activities involving bulls are scheduled in one day. Elsewhere in Catalonia there are other municipalities that program such bull runs, such as El Morell and Mont-roig del Camp in Tarragona.\nVidreres is the only municipality in Girona province that continues to run fiestas involving bulls, after Torroella de Montgr\u00ed, Olot and Roses opted not to continue with them. In Barcelona province, they are to be found in Cardona and Santpedor, while Badalona and Vilafranca del Pened\u00e8s also offered them, after taking them off their programs several years ago.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/03/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
