[...] In recent days, your behavior has been moving precisely in the opposite direction,\u201d reads the letter. Shortly after 9.30am, S\u00e1nchez said in a Twitter message that he had spoken with Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau to show his support. The mayor reportedly called for dialogue between the Spanish and Catalan governments: \u201cIf two sides want to talk, they find a way, either through third parties or however.\u201d\nAcabo de conversar con la alcaldesa @AdaColau para trasladarle todo nuestro apoyo y solidaridad a la ciudadan\u00eda de Barcelona.El Gobierno de Espa\u00f1a trabaja para garantizar la seguridad y la convivencia. pic.twitter.com/AYuEjafJIX\nI\u2019ve just had a conversation with Mayor Ada Colau to express all our support and solidarity with the citizens of Barcelona. The government of Spain is working to guarantee safety and social harmony.\nOn Saturday, following particularly aggressive attacks on the police by groups of demonstrators in Barcelona the night before, Torra only went as far as to call for \u201cresponsibility,\u201d and to request a meeting with Pedro S\u00e1nchez to begin \u201cthe dialogue\u201d that the independence movement has been demanding for months. Torra also telephoned S\u00e1nchez, who refused to take the call until the former \u201cunequivocally condemns the violent behavior that has taken place in several parts of Catalonia, sometimes even not far from his own office,\u201d according to the letter.\nSpain\u2019s caretaker interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, said on Sunday that 288 police officers were injured in the weekend street violence, and 194 people arrested, 70 of whom have been brought before a judge and 18 remanded in custody.\nFor the first time in a week, the roads and streets of Barcelona were clear of roadblocks and demonstrators on Monday, easing traffic congestion in the Catalan capital.\nThe protests began on Monday of last week after Spain\u2019s Supreme Court announced its decision to sentence nine separatist leaders to prison for their role in the illegal attempt to break away from Spain in 2017.\nThe independence movement had been anticipating an adverse ruling and organizing a popular response through a platform called Democratic Tsunami, which uses social media to mobilize supporters. On Friday, Spain\u2019s High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, ordered the Civil Guard to close down the group\u2019s webpages and social media accounts.\nLos concentrados encienden las linternas de sus m\u00f3viles para \"q se vea la cantidad de basura lanzada\".

The Media Markt store in Plaza de Catalunya had its windows smashed in. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken everything they could, but especially cellphones and scooters,\u201d said a store manager.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/21/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
