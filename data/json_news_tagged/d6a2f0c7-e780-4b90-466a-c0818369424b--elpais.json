The meetings, which will take place on September 16 and 17, will be the last before Spaniards are potentially called back to the polls once more, with a likely November 10 vote marking the fourth time in as many years that Spain holds a general election.\nThe king took the decision after meeting on Thursday morning with the speaker of Congress, Meritxell Batet. The Spanish monarch will decide on September 17 whether or not there is a candidate who has the option of being voted in as prime minister.\nIn August, the king stated that the best option was to \u201cfind a solution before going to elections\u201d\nSince the inconclusive general election of April 28, acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez \u2013 whose Socialist Party (PSOE) won most votes but fell short of a majority \u2013 has been in talks with left-wing Unidas Podemos (a coalition of the United Left party and Podemos) over the possibility of forming a government. But these discussions have come to nothing, and S\u00e1nchez already lost the first investiture vote in Congress back in July.\nAfter meeting with the king, Batet told the press that she agreed with him that there \u201cis a need for a stable government as soon as possible, one that can work for four years.\u201d Speaking in August, the king stated that the best option was to \u201cfind a solution before going to elections.\u201d\nShould there be a breakthrough in the negotiations between the parties, a first round of voting could be held on September 19, with the second round, at which a simple majority (more yes votes than no votes) is needed, on September 21. But before this could happen it would be essential for S\u00e1nchez to show that he has the support to win the vote. He will not stand at another investiture debate if he lacks the support, the PSOE have been at pains to state over recent weeks.\nThe main sticking point between the PSOE and Unidas Podemos has been the latter\u2019s demand for a coalition government\nThe main sticking point between the PSOE and Unidas Podemos has been the latter\u2019s demand for a coalition government and to be given places in the Cabinet, something that S\u00e1nchez has rejected. A deal or a complete breakdown of negotiations is likely to materialize this weekend, before the king begins his meetings.\nThe consultations will mark the seventh time that Felipe VI has met with political leaders in this context in the five years of his reign so far. His father, King Juan Carlos I, called just 10 such meetings in the space of 39 years. The change reflects the end of the two-party system (PSOE and the conservative Popular Party (PP)) that dominated Spanish politics from the return to democracy until this decade, which has seen the emergence not just of Podemos, but also center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) and far-right Vox. The PP, Ciudadanos and Vox all voted against S\u00e1nchez at the first investiture vote in July, and have vowed to do so again.\nTraditionally, it is the candidate who initiates contact with potential partners in government. But Podemos chief Pablo Iglesias said on Wednesday that he would be taking the initiative and would likely be calling S\u00e1nchez at some point today to try to break the deadlock. He said that his demands would be the same: a coalition government, with members of his party in the Cabinet. However, speaking in Congress on Wednesday, the acting prime minister clearly stated that he would not accept such an arrangement. For S\u00e1nchez, the only option is a minority PSOE government with a governing program agreed between the two parties.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/12/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
