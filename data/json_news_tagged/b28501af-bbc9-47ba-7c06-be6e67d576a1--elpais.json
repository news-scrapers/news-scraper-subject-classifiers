The Mossos have opened an investigation to clarify what happened, and an autopsy is also pending.\nOfficers had been looking for the man since September 5, when a woman died after being stabbed in violent attempted robbery at a nightclub called Smar in Port Ol\u00edmpic. Security cameras from the nightclub recorded what happened. At 3am, the woman was alerted by a witness to the fact that two men were trying to steal her cellphone. The woman turned to a security guard, who reprimanded the two thieves and kicked them out of the nightclub. As the security guard was escorting them out, one of the men stabbed him in the abdomen and then the 26-year-old in the chest. Both stab victims were taken by ambulance to Hospital del Mar, where the woman died minutes later.\nThe two suspects fled the scene without being detained, but were identified the next day as locals from the San Adri\u00e0 del Bes\u00f2s neighborhood, thanks to the security camera footage. The other man who took part in the robbery handed himself in to authorities on September 12. After taking his statement, a judge ordered he be placed in pre-trial custody.\nA security guard was also injured in the violent robbery in early September\nAccording to police sources, the murder suspect committed suicide on Thursday night after realizing he was about to be arrested.\nSo far this year, 13 people have met with a violent death in Barcelona, and police are still investigating the death of an elderly couple inside their home in August.\nThere were 49,300 crime reports between January and March in Barcelona, half of which were for theft. But the biggest cause for concern is the rise in violent theft (28%), representing around 40 cases a day.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/27/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
