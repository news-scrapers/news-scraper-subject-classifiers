He also refused to remove esteladas \u2013 the unofficial flag adopted by supporters of Catalan independence \u2013 and yellow ribbons \u2013 a symbol of support for the jailed separatist leaders \u2013 from buildings belonging to the regional government.\nDuring today\u2019s hearing, Torra told the court that he disobeyed the instruction from the National Electoral Commission (JEC) to take down the symbols because, he claimed, \u201cit was an illegal order.\u201d\nIn around 30 minutes of statements during which he only took questions from the defense, Torra questioned the authority of the JEC and its impartiality, accusing its members of prevaricaci\u00f3n \u2013 knowingly issuing an unfair decision \u2013 and even of coercion.\n\u201cI have many duties as a premier, and the first is to defend the rights and freedoms of the people,\u201d he said. \u201cI will never order the removal of a [yellow] ribbon or estelada. We are talking about censorship and the violation of rights. It was an act of censorship and I was not willing to allow it,\u201d he added.\nAccording to Torra, yellow ribbons \u201care not political but part of the people\u2019s heritage.\u201d He also said that not all the public buildings exhibiting separatist symbols were the property of the Catalan government. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel I had to give orders to a school principal or to a hospital director regarding any kind of decision,\u201d he said.\nThe disobedience trial will end on Monday after a single hearing. A guilty verdict could still be challenged before the Supreme Court, but the latter\u2019s decisions are final, meaning that Torra could cease to be the head of the Catalan government, and the regional parliament would then have to choose a successor.\nThis could prove complicated, as the combined forces of the two main separatist parties in the Catalan legislature \u2013 34 seats for Together for Catalonia (JxCat) and 32 for the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) \u2013 are not enough for a majority in the 135-seat house. The four lawmakers for the other separatist group, the far-left CUP, have announced that they would rather hold early elections than support a new regional leader. This option is also preferred by Ciudadanos (Citizens), the Catalan Socialist Party (PSC), Catalunya en Com\u00fa Podem (an alliance of Catalonia in Common and Podemos) and the conservative Popular Party (PP).\nIn the event that Torra is barred from office, the parliament would be automatically dissolved two months after the first investiture vote to appoint a new government leader. Torra\u2019s deputy, Pere Aragon\u00e8s of ERC, would become the caretaker premier and new elections would be held 40 to 60 days after being called.\nCatalonia last held an election in December 2017, when the region was under direct rule from Madrid following the failed secession bid. Torra was sworn into office in May 2018.\nSeparatist politicians have stated that an appeal could be dealt with by February at the latest, but the average time for the Supreme Court to hand down a final decision is around one year. In the case of Artur Mas, a former Catalan premier who organized an earlier unofficial independence consultation, the process took 21 months.\nIn the meantime, there are other factors that could also affect Catalan politics. On December 16, a court in Brussels will hold a hearing to decide whether former Catalan premier Carles Puigdemont will be extradited to Spain to face charges of sedition over the breakaway bid. Puigdemont fled with several government aides after the unilateral independence declaration of October 2017, and has since been fighting extradition to Spain, where he is wanted on sedition charges.\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is also about to deliver a decision on Oriol Junqueras, the leader of the ERC party and Puigdemont\u2019s former deputy premier. Although Junqueras has been sentenced to 13 years in prison in Spain for leading the independence push, the CJEU is deciding whether the politician \u2013 who successfully ran as a candidate to the European Parliament in May \u2013 has parliamentary immunity and the right to his seat as an MEP.\nA decision favorable to Junqueras could also apply to Puigdemont, who picked up a seat in the European Parliament as well.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/18/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
