Last Saturday, as hundreds of demonstrators brought traffic to a standstill at Sants train station, Armas decided she had had enough and began to yell at them.\nFortunately the roadblocks are always short, because these revolutionaries are the kind who like to be home in time for a warm meal and a soft bed\nJuan Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, store manager\n\u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of it. At the bar where I work, business is doing badly and I keep having to change my route to go home. One night [protesters] blocked my car with my son inside, on Arag\u00f3n street. We were surrounded by hooded teenagers,\u201d she recently recalled.\nTwo anonymous organizations, the Committees to Defend the Republic (CDR) and Democratic Tsunami, are behind these acts. These groups, which are under investigation by the courts, enjoy support from Catalonia\u2019s pro-independence government, from separatist parties and from many of the latter\u2019s voters.\n\u201cThere will be chaos as long as there as hostages, as long as there is no freedom of expression and assembly, and as long as we cannot exercise self-determination,\u201d said the CDR in a recent statement.\nLuc\u00eda Flores experienced the chaos first-hand on the day that the Supreme Court released its ruling. That day, she spent three hours trapped inside her car with her two small children, aged one and four, on the C-58 highway near the Terrassa exit.\n\u201cThe children were cold and they were crying. I, too, started to cry out of helplessness, and they laughed at me,\u201d she said. Flores works in Sabadell, and these last few weeks she has been leaving work one hour early just to make sure she makes it in time to pick up her eldest from school.\nJavier, Ronney and Ventura, who work at a company called Integra2, experienced the effects of the occupation of the AP-7 highway last Wednesday, when 500 vehicles were caught between groups of protesters. Drivers and passengers were forced to spend the night on the road.\n\u201cI neither agree nor disagree with them, but I am incensed at having had to go 15 hours without sleep,\u201d said Javier. \u201cGovernment leaders aren\u2019t doing anything about it,\u201d added Ventura. On Wednesday, Catalonia\u2019s deputy premier Pere Aragon\u00e9s urged independence protesters to keep up the pressure.\nNot everyone was upset about the three-day chaos on the AP-7, however. \u201cThey have to fight, I understand,\u201d said Albert Surinyac, a truck driver who only had one kilometer left to go when he got caught up in the traffic snarl. \u201cIt was a pain in the ass, but we weren\u2019t lacking for anything. They even went car to car offering people food and everything.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a revolution, but a nickel-and-dime one, because Catalonia actually has one of the best living standards in the world,\u201d said Juan Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, the manager at a mattress store in Sant Adri\u00e0 de Bes\u00f2s. The national motorway N-II linking this town to Barcelona has been blocked several times in the last few weeks, always in front of Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s establishment.\n\u201cResidents have had it. Fortunately the roadblocks are always short, because these revolutionaries are the kind who like to be home in time for a warm meal and a soft bed,\u201d he noted. \u201cI\u2019d never seen a revolution where the oppressors are the working class from Sant Adri\u00e0 and the oppressed are the elites.\u201d\nRizwan Faruq, a taxi driver who lives on Universitat square, said that business has been \u201cgreatly affected\u201d by recent events in Catalonia. \u201cEver since October I\u2019ve been earning 40% less because people are taking fewer taxis and there are fewer tourists,\u201d he said. \u201cI have three children and I cannot afford to lose money. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been putting in up to 14 hours instead of nine \u2013 as long as it takes to make what I need.\u201d\nThe roadblocks have also affected health workers. Carmen Mart\u00ednez, who works at Vall d\u2019Hebron hospital in Barcelona and lives in Vall\u00e8s Occidental, said she is getting home a full hour late. \u201cI think it\u2019s fine for them to protest, as long as they don\u2019t hurt others, which they are doing,\u201d she said.\nVicent Tamarit, a retired farmer from Valencia who was forced to drag his suitcase on foot after the CDR blocked the Sants train station, recalled what it was like traveling across Catalonia when he was a young man. \u201cBack then this place was a role model. What\u2019s going on now is really sad.\u201d\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/18/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
