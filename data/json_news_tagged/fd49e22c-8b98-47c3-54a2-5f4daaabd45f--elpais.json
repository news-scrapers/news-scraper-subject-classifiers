The first question the agreement raises is just that: if it was possible to sign an agreement in just a few hours, why were six months spent fruitlessly and new elections called?\nBoth leaders have a duty to to provide a more coherent explanation than the one that has been offered. In any case, the fact that two political forces have announced their willingness to govern together is an important step forward with respect to the former deadlock. But many details of the agreement have yet to be revealed, particularly the parliamentary strategy that the parties will follow to secure the support they still lack.\nIf it was possible to sign an agreement in just a few hours, why were six months spent fruitlessly and new elections called?\nFor now, the document signed by Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Pablo Iglesias is a declaration of intent, as they themselves admit. Until more details emerge about the content of the deal, and how many votes it can muster \u2013 not only for appointing the new prime minister, but also for forming an effective government \u2013 the public display of goodwill by both leaders could have a positive effect by indeed increasing the chances of reaching a majority government. But it could also close the door to other alternatives and offer easy excuses for a return to the sterility of bloc politics.\nThe document that has been signed and presented to Congress is not a governing program, because it is written in such broad terms that it could contemplate any sort of measure. The most interesting part of it is that this general vagueness is absent from the one main point where it would have been unacceptable: the territorial crisis in Catalonia. In the document, both parties pledge to seek solutions within the framework of the Constitution, from which it might be deduced that Unidas Podemos has given up on recognizing Catalonia\u2019s right to self-determination and on its demands for a referendum as the way out of the Catalan conundrum.\nIt is an important step forward. Now the question is whether these promises can be kept if, as it appears, S\u00e1nchez and Iglesias\u2019 project for a mutual investiture requires participation by the Catalan independence parties, whether through active support or an abstention.\nThe fact that S\u00e1nchez and Iglesias did not take questions at their news conference is not the best way to get started\nThe formulas to take Spain out of its current paralysis cannot rely purely on arithmetic combinations, but should take into account unavoidable political factors. No solution for Catalonia can possibly be found by ignoring the main opposition Popular Party (PP), much less in the current circumstances, when pressure from the far right could place the main opposition party in a position where it feels tempted to radicalize its own rhetoric to prevent losing support.\nThe plan to give Iglesias one of Spain\u2019s several possible deputy prime ministerial roles, after S\u00e1nchez had vetoed this idea during the previous political term, requires an explanation from the Socialist leader. This will surely also force him to clear things up in Brussels, which had welcomed the campaign announcement that caretaker Economy Minister Nadia Calvi\u00f1o would become the new deputy prime minister for economic affairs. The two (or three?) deputy PM positions opening up will evidently be very different from one another.\nThese and other questions are still awaiting answers. And the fact that the caretaker PM and the leader of Unidas Podemos did not take any questions at their Tuesday news conference is not the best way to get started.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson and Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/13/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
