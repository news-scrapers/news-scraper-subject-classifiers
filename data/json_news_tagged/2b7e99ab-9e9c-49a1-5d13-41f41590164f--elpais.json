There were 33 arrests and nearly 100 people required medical assistance \u2013 including 30 law-enforcement officers \u2013 following the five-hour standoff.\nThe fresh night of street violence came in the wake of the Spanish Supreme Court\u2019s decision, made public on Monday, to sentence nine Catalan separatist leaders to prison terms for their role in the illegal breakaway bid of 2017.\nThe independence movement had widely anticipated an adverse decision and organized mass protests that included blockading Barcelona\u2019s busy airport on Monday. The demonstrations have been largely peaceful, but the Spanish government has pointed to several \u201ccoordinated groups that are using street violence\u201d to create a sense of chaos.\nLos @BCN_Bombers apagan lo que parecen las \u00faltimas barricadas #Barcelona #tsumanidemocratic #SentenciaProces pic.twitter.com/IpfoqJQS2n\nBarcelona firefighters extinguish what seem to be the last barricades.\nThe scenes were similar to those seen on Tuesday night, except there were fewer, more aggressive protesters. The violence began at around 9pm, following a peaceful demonstration by a crowd of around 22,000 people at the intersection of Gran Via and Marina street. Small groups of protesters walked over to the headquarters of the home affairs department, which was being protected by officers from the Catalan law enforcement agency Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, and began shaking the metal fence panels while calling for the resignation of department chief Miquel Buch.\nBarricada en el Consell de Cent #Barcelona #tsumanidemocratic #SentenciaDelProc\u00e9s pic.twitter.com/zysfH7CiW3\nBarricade in Consell de Cent.\nThe mood quickly became more tense, and the Mossos used their vans to force the protesters away from the spot while the latter hurled objects at them. Meanwhile, trash containers were set alight on the corner of Casp and N\u00e0pols streets, and there were moments of panic when the flames reached a nearby commercial establishment.\nOn Roger de Flor street, a man with a baby in his arms came out of a building shouting at the protestors after seeing the flames approaching his home. Bars and hotels shut their doors and pulled down the blinds while patrons watched the running battles taking place outside. Several people were injured at this spot, including at least one young woman who was hit in the head with a rubber bullet. \u201cI don\u2019t really know how it happened,\u201d she told the medical team that came to help her.\nCalle Roger de Flor.

Deputy Mayor Jaume Collboni on Thursday said there were more than 50 in that area alone.\nNearby, the fire from several burning containers reached a dozen parked vehicles and a motorcycle, which also went up in flames. The cars were parked near a gas station that was under police custody.\nCatalan police sources said that some protesters had aimed rockets of the kind used in fireworks displays at one of the helicopters flying overhead. They also reported that some officers were targeted with large rocks and acid.\nOn Gran Via, the clashes became so intense that at around midnight Mossos officers were forced to retreat, drawing cheers from the protesters who decided to end the street battle there and move to a new spot on the corner of Passeig de Sant Joan and Diagonal.\nIn Tarragona, a young protester who had climbed onto a barricade was run over by a police vehicle during clashes in the city center. Four people were arrested and two sustained injuries.\nIn Girona, a demonstration of around 5,000 people descended into violence when several protesters began hurling objects at the police officers protecting a Spanish government building, and tore down the metal fence panels around its perimeter.\nIn Lleida, a peaceful demonstration also turned violent when around 200 individuals lit fires and burned containers near the Spanish government delegation, on Roger de Ll\u00f9ria street.\nIn Madrid, the National Police arrested four youths for public order offenses following a demonstration in Sol square in support of the convicted secessionist leaders.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/17/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
