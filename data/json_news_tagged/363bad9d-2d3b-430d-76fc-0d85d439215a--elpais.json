There is a leopard from Zimbabwe, a tiger from Thailand, a lion from South Africa, an ocelot wildcat from Mexico, a cheetah from Namibia and a white rhinoceros from Angola.\nPut together, I have been shooting for 24 hours a day over the course of 11 years and three months of my life\nMarcial G\u00f3mez Sequeira\n\u201cNot even I could tell you all the animals that I have managed to hunt in the 48 years I have spent traveling the world big game hunting, but it is in the thousands, with more than 420 species,\u201d he says.\nAnd in a few months, he adds, his collection will be at the heart of the biggest hunting museum in the world, which is set to open in Olivenza, a village in one of Spain\u2019s poorest regions, Extremadura.\nMarcial G\u00f3mez Sequeira was, until 1988, the biggest shareholder in Sanitas, a company founded by his father Marcial G\u00f3mez Gil. In 1988, G\u00f3mez Sequeira sold his shares for almost 22 billion pesetas, the equivalent of \u20ac130 million, to the British private healthcare company BUPA.\nThis time last year, he was convicted of tax evasion in connection with the sale of Sanitas, sentenced to two months in prison and ordered to pay a fine of \u20ac260,000 plus \u20ac287,000 in damages to the Treasury for creating a dummy corporation in order to making illegal tax savings. \u201cThe buyers themselves prepared the sale in a way to avoid as much tax as possible, but legally,\u201d says G\u00f3mez Sequeira. \u201cAnd this comes down on me 30 years later.\u201d\nG\u00f3mez Sequeira used the money from the sale to pursue his trophy hunting. \u201cThree years ago I tried to calculate the time I have spent hunting,\u201d he says. \u201cI worked out that I had been shooting for 24 hours a day over the course of 11 years and three months of my life. Firing bullets non-stop.\u201d\nAs he points to a wolf from Alaska, a monkey from Cameroon, an armadillo from the US, an African golden cat from Liberia, a spotted hyena from Mozambique, a crocodile from Tanzania and a polar bear from Canada, G\u00f3mez Sequeira explains that his hunting has taken him and his 300 Weatherby rifle several times around the world. The result is a sort of Noah\u2019s ark, only the animals are dead.\nAt 79, G\u00f3mez Sequeira has now decided to move his collection of trophies out of his house to save his family complications after his death. \u201cIt occurred to me to get in touch with Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Vara, who is a distant cousin of mine,\u201d he says, referring to the head of the regional government in Extremadura, of the Socialist Party (PSOE). \u201cAnd it occurred to us both that we could take my hunting trophies to Extremadura and set up a museum there.\u201d\nFern\u00e1ndez Vara and the mayor of Olivenza, Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Andrade (PSOE), have confirmed to EL PA\u00cdS that a preliminary agreement was signed in March to set up the Marcial G\u00f3mez Sequeira Collection Hunting Museum, which aims to display 1,250 trophies inside an 18th-century building known as the Cavalry Barracks. By comparison, the collections of the Museum of Hunting and Nature in Paris, and the Safari Club International Museum in Tucson, fall short of the 420 species killed by G\u00f3mez Sequeira.\nG\u00f3mez Sequeira is keen to point out that he is not a socialist. He is a Francoist and he makes no apologies for it\n\u201cHunting is accepted as a fairly normal activity in Extremadura,\u201d says the regional premier Fern\u00e1ndez Vara, a doctor by trade who opts to focus on the scientific aspect of the collection. \u201cThere are a million of us and 100,000 people have a hunting license. The museum could be tremendously important for tourism.\u201d\nThe preliminary agreement signed by G\u00f3mez Sequeira and Fern\u00e1ndez Vara involves handing the collection over to a new semi-public foundation and calculating its financial value so that Extremadura authorities can invest half of that again. \u201cThe collection could be worth tens of millions of euros,\u201d says G\u00f3mez Sequeira. \u201cBut we are being prudent and putting it at no more than \u20ac10 million to \u20ac12 million, so that the budget isn\u2019t too much for the regional government.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the regional premier goes on to explain the family connection between himself and G\u00f3mez Sequeira. \u201cMy parents and Marcial\u2019s parents were third cousins, but they knew each other well,\u201d he says, adding that he referred to the Sanitas founder as Uncle Marcial. The grandfather of G\u00f3mez Sequeira was mayor of Olivenza and a landowner who, according to the historian Paul Preston, was part of the delegation that asked Franco\u2019s forces in October 1936 to make \u201cthe socialist and communist masses give back the land that was redistributed during the Second Republic.\u201d\nG\u00f3mez Sequeira is keen to point out that he is not a socialist. He is a Francoist and he makes no apologies for it. The man who once controlled 52% of Sanitas has a sticker of the Franco-era Spanish flag on the back of his iPhone. And as he walks through the various wings of his home in La Moraleja, he points out paintings by Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla and also a life-size portrait of Francisco Franco in full military attire, presiding over a billiard table. G\u00f3mez Sequeira remembers buying the painting for 25,000 pesetas (\u20ac150) after the death of the dictator in 1975 at the Dur\u00e1n auction house. \u201cWhen Franco died, someone must have wanted to get rid of the painting because there was a lot of fear,\u201d he says.\nThe first time G\u00f3mez Sequeira went on a hunting safari was in 1971 in Mozambique. He paid 60,000 pesetas (\u20ac360) and killed 35 species, including a zebra, a lion, a hippopotamus and an elephant. That was when he got the idea of collecting trophies, like others might collect stamps. \u201cThis is the collection of small antelopes,\u201d says the man who refers to his hunting escapades as \u201ccrusades.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all of them. It even surprises me. I understand how people walking into the hall might say, \u2018Bah! You can\u2019t have been able to hunt all this by yourself.\u2019 And yes, that makes sense because I myself have my doubts. It seems impossible that I could have killed all these animals, but that\u2019s 48 years\u2019 worth, hunting on three or four safaris a year.\u201d\nG\u00f3mez Sequeira, who studied medicine before becoming an entrepreneur, goes on to explain that over the course of 10 years he owned four planes. \u201cOne at a time, of course, each better than the last,\u201d he says. \u201cI hunted a lot. I went to London, I went up to the Arctic, I went to Finland, Greenland; I crossed the whole of Canada and reached the Bering Strait. I went to the United States and spent time with some friends to a ranch I co-owned in Texas. And then I returned via the Azores. It was a very long trip but very productive.\u201d\nThe latest trend among international hunters is paying to kill animals of unusual colors. In South Africa, the owners of ranches auction off uniquely colored members of any one species after raising them in captivity. G\u00f3mez Sequeira went on one of these \u201ccolor safaris\u201d as he calls them in 2018 with his 15-year-old grandson. He killed a golden wildebeest, a black impala, a golden oryx and a copper-colored Springbok.\n\u201cFour years ago, it cost \u20ac30,000 to \u20ac40,000 to kill a golden wildebeest. Now you can do it for a reasonable price,\u201d says G\u00f3mez Sequeira, stopping beside a golden wildebeest that looks all but alive as it stands in a state of suspended animation on top of two fruit boxes. \u201cHunting one of these animals can now cost between \u20ac6,000 and \u20ac10,000.\u201d\nRecalling how he shot the animal, G\u00f3mez Sequeira says that it was lying down behind a termite mound. He waited until it got up before shooting it broadside to make sure he didn\u2019t damage the horns. \u201cI usually aim at the armpit area because that can be perfectly repaired afterwards,\u201d he says. \u201cThe point where the bullet enters is very small and where it comes out, if it does, gets very damaged but it can be sewn up quickly,\u201d he explains, showing the spot on his own torso where the bullet enters before reaching the heart.\nG\u00f3mez Sequeira\u2019s hunting anecdotes are peppered with recognizable figures. \u201cWhen I arrived in Persia in 1973,\u201d he says, \u201cI went to the Shah\u2019s hunting reserve. And who was there but [former Spanish] King Juan Carlos, who had been invited by the Shah\u2019s brother. Juan Carlos is two years older than me. He was born in 1938 and I was born in 1940. We have had a great friendship and I admire him a lot. He has also received me as a director of Real Madrid when we won the trophies that he handed out. Juan Carlos is a great partridge hunter. I have hunted with him quite often.\u201d\nG\u00f3mez Sequeira sat on Real Madrid\u2019s board of directors during the presidency of Ram\u00f3n Mendoza and Lorenzo Sanz. In 2006, he put himself forward again as a candidate together with the constructor Juan Miguel Villar-Mir. \u201cLegally, we won,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n robbed us of that,\u201d he adds, referring to the election fraud scandal when Calder\u00f3n,\u00a0former Real president, asked for postal votes to be discounted. \u201cHe got the kind of female judge that is as quick to say that Franco\u2019s body has to be exhumed as that postal votes don\u2019t count.\u201d\nKing Juan Carlos is among the acquaintances who have visited his hunting trophies in La Moraleja, according to G\u00f3mez Sequeira himself, who is now sitting between a stuffed lion and a tiger. \u201cI have had government leaders from Spain and other countries here,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a slaughterer. I don\u2019t hunt for numbers; I prefer quality, specialties.\u201d\nLast February, a US trophy hunter paid $110,000 to kill a rare protected mountain goat in Pakistan, one that is absent from G\u00f3mez Sequeira\u2019s collection. \u201cI\u2019m not going for it because it costs \u20ac100,000 and the circumstances are not right,\u201d he says. \u201cI realize that I\u2019m old and that there is little hunting time left in me and, more importantly, the strength to go out in the countryside and keep shooting. But I\u2019ll keep hunting as long as my body holds up.\u201d\nThe publication of this article has prompted the mayor of Olivenza, Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Andrade to withdraw his support for G\u00f3mez Sequeira\u2019s proposed hunting museum. \u201cThis project does not represent us, it does not represent the men and women of this town, nor does it represent the future of progress in Olivenza, which is why it will not be given space in any public municipal building \u201d he wrote in a message on Facebook on Wednesday.\nThe mayor signed a preliminary agreement in March with the premier of Extremadura, Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Vara and G\u00f3mez Sequeira to display the animal trophies, but decided to reject the plan after being made aware of the hunter\u2019s statements to EL PA\u00cdS.\n\u201cThe statements from this man [in the EL PA\u00cdS article] are based on a concept of hunting that is diametrically opposed to the sustainable hunting in the rural area, in which he boats not only of being a Francoist, but of having killed more than 420 animal species, some of them in danger of extinction, while downplaying the financial crimes of trying to avoid paying taxes for the sale of his business,\u201d the mayor added in his statement on Facebook.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.", "date": "10/09/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
