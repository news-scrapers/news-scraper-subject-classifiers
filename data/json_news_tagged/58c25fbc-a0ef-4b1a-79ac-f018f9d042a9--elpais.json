These are not places that are just dangerous to their population, but rather places that irradiate conflict and instability to neighboring nations or even to other continents.\nKashmir just about always makes the list. The heavily disputed border between India, Pakistan and China has long been a flashpoint for armed conflicts. It doesn\u2019t help that both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons, which increases the possibility that a skirmish could escalate into a serious threat to world peace. Syria, another country that often ranks high on the list, illustrates how these localized conflicts can end up destabilizing an entire region, if not the globe. Now Turkey is taking advantage of international circumstances to conquer new territory, alter borders, and subdue the Kurds. And there are many other places where local or cross-border clashes have the potential to explode into larger international conflicts, including in the Arabian Peninsula, the Persian Gulf, the countries of the North Caucasus, and the Korean Peninsula, to name a few.\nThe president who portrayed himself as a perpetual winner has not only proved to be a loser but also someone easily manipulated by the most infamous dictators of our time\nBut our list of world trouble spots needs an update. Today, the most serious threats to global stability are radiating from one point: Washington, D.C. Or, more precisely, the White House.\nThe president who portrayed himself as a master negotiator and a perpetual winner has not only proved to be a loser but also someone easily manipulated by the most infamous dictators of our time. Let\u2019s take a look at the scorecard: Trump\u2019s new friend, the sadistic dictator of North Korea, convinced him that he was willing to dismantle his country\u2019s nuclear arsenal, if Washington lifted sanctions. But of course, the Korean tyrant has continued testing his warheads and the long-range missiles that could carry them. The autocratic president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, persuaded Trump to withdraw US troops from Syria and let Turkish forces invade the north in order to \u201cneutralize\u201d Kurdish militias. Trump ignored the decisive role the Kurds played in the fierce fight against the Islamic State. Trump\u2019s concession to his Turkish friend is costing him big inside and outside of the United States. In fact, allowing Erdogan\u2019s bellicose adventure achieved what had hitherto been impossible: uniting Republicans and Democrats in Congress against the president\u2019s decision.\nIt is also evident that President Trump feels more comfortable with his other best friend, Vladimir Putin, than with his own country\u2019s Congress. Exhibit A: Trump\u2019s decision to veto a resolution proposed by the European Union condemning Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria. Which other country vetoed the resolution? Russia.\nTrump keeps piling on the losses: a destructive trade war with China, withdrawing the US from the Iran nuclear deal, his handling of the crisis between Saudi Arabia and its neighbors, his negotiations with the Taliban, his weakening of America\u2019s relationship with its European allies, and, of course, his attempts to put US foreign policy at the service of his personal interests, whether that be winning the next election or making money. America\u2019s loss of power and influence during Trump\u2019s watch will likely be remembered as one of the most devastating instances of geopolitical self-sabotage in history. Yet despite Trump\u2019s amazing ability to destabilize the world, the greatest danger emanating from the White House today is not international. It\u2019s domestic.\nPresident Trump is increasingly testing the Constitution and the rules on which American democracy depends\nThe president is increasingly testing the Constitution and the rules on which American democracy depends. Trump has challenged Congress by denying lawmakers their Constitutional right to obtain documents as well as their right to subpoena public officials or citizens who have relevant information. The president\u2019s vitriolic attacks on his political opponents, on former allies and co-workers who have since renounced him, and on journalists and the media, are constant and growing. This is not simply the verbal excess of a histrionic politician; it is dangerously antidemocratic behavior.\nThe threats facing democracies were memorably noted by a young American politician in 1838. Abraham Lincoln, then 28, explained that, to counteract those threats, his country had to cultivate a \u201cpolitical religion\u201d that emphasized reverence for the rule of law and a dependence on \u201creason, cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason.\u201d It is obvious that Donald Trump does not feel beholden to the laws or the truth, which means that the United States must depend on its institutions and its other leaders to preserve its democracy. Much is at stake.\nA strong American democracy not only benefits the US, but also the rest of the world. That is why the recent attempts to undermine democracy in Washington make it the most dangerous place on Earth.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros\nLOG IN TO CONTINUE READING\nYou can read this article just by having a user account, which is free.\nThank you for reading EL PA\u00cdS\nHaven\u2019t registered?
