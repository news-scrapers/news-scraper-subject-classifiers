EL PA\u00cdS has seen the contents of this letter, dated October 14, which reminds the executive of its \u201cpledge to respect the dignity\u201d of the mortal remains during their transfer to El Pardo-Mingorrubio cemetery. The exhumation is expected to take place before October 25, according to a government decision approved by the Cabinet on Friday.\nMoving Franco\u2019s body out of the Valley of the Fallen, a monument located near the monastery of El Escorial, has been a signature project of the caretaker prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez of the Socialist Party (PSOE), and it was approved by a majority of lawmakers inside Congress on September 13, 2018.\nLast week the Supreme Court issued a decision unblocking the remaining legal challenges\nBut the project has been delayed by legal hurdles placed by Franco\u2019s family, who wished to keep the body in the Valley. At one point, his relatives said they would agree to move Franco\u2019s remains, but only to La Almudena cathedral, a major tourist attraction in the heart of Madrid.\nLast week the Supreme Court issued a decision unblocking the remaining legal challenges and paving the way for the exhumation. Prior Santiago Cantera, the leader of the religious community that lives in the Valley, has agreed to hold a special Mass after having previously stated that he would not allow workers to enter the basilica to open Franco\u2019s grave.\nThe letter reminds the government of its obligation to \u201cstrictly follow the law,\u201d which contemplates military funeral honors for former heads of government if relatives request them. In the Franco family\u2019s view, the former dictator is eligible as he headed the government between 1936 and 1973, and it expects a ceremony involving an honor detail and a band to play the national anthem, present arms and perform a gun salute. The Franco family also wants the coffin to be covered with a Spanish flag while it is being transferred, and a Mass to be held during the reburial.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/15/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
