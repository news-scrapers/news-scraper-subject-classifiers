But since then, not a single indefinite employment contract has been signed in any investigation center, explains Luis Serrano, who is the president of the SOMM alliance (SOMMa), which brings together 25 research centers and 23 university units, and which receives additional financing from the government given their competitiveness.\n\u201cWe simply cannot implement this kind of contract,\u201d says Mar\u00eda Blasco, the director of the National Center for Oncological Research (CNIO) and the vice-president of SOMMa. The Science Ministry, which is headed up by former Spanish astronaut Pedro Duque, has defended its package of measures and says that more time is needed to begin to implement them.\n\u201cAfter all these months, the situation has not advanced because the urgent measures have not solved all of the problems in science,\u201d explains Serrano, who is a biochemist. SOMMa represents the elite of Spanish science, and the centers and units that belong to the alliance carry out cutting-edge research in areas including cancer, cardiovascular illnesses, astronomy and quantum computing. It represents around 7,000 employees dedicated to research and accounts for more than \u20ac500 million in European funding alone.\nIn February, the science minister announced a package of urgent measures to \u201cthrow off the chains\u201d that were oppressing the scientific laboratories in the country. The minister was referring to the bureaucracy and excessive funding control that had been imposed by the former Popular Party (PP) government of Mariano Rajoy, in a bid to control public spending as much as possible. Another of the star measures announced by Pedro Duque was the introduction of indefinite contracts for scientists, in a bid to end the abuse of temporary contracts and the instability that has been prevalent in the sector for years.\nSources from SOMMa explain that the kind of indefinite contract directly linked to a research project that the government presented in February has no legal backing, given that such an arrangement does not exist within the Social Security system. What\u2019s more, it is unclear whether such contracts would be subject to the hiring limits set each year by the government according to the available budget. \u201cAnother problem is that if we issue an indefinite contract for a project that lasts four years, when we rescind that contract at the end of that time period, it could be found to be an unfair dismissal or the employee in question could even take the matter to court and walk away with a permanent position,\u201d they explain from these research centers.\nSerrano and Blasco say that these problems were raised with the minister at two meetings, the last of which took place in August. The scientists are calling on the government to publish \u201can explanatory note\u201d that would clear the way for hiring. \u201cWe are puzzled because we have been discussing this issue since February,\u201d Blasco complains.\nThe contracts of at least 236 people are in doubt for 2020\nIn addition to this problem, 15 centers and units face an imminent lack of financing. According to a calendar approved by the central government, the analysis and go-ahead for new funding requests will not be carried out until November 2020, meaning that several research centers could lose up to nine months of funding. Next year, another 13 centers will have the same problem. This will, Serrano states, \u201cmean that people will have to be fired.\u201d His organization calculates that the contracts of at least 236 people are in doubt for 2020.\nThe Science Ministry argues that their urgent measures \u201chave served to improve a lot of situations that were damaging science,\u201d such as an end to a dedicated Tax Agency official in each center, tasked with imposing immediate levies on the accounts.\nAs for the concerns of Serrano and Blasco, the ministry says that more clarification is unnecessary and invites research centers and units to begin to issue contracts immediately. \u201cThe regulation of indefinite contracts based on projects does not need subsequent regulatory development, but it does need time before it can be implemented,\u201d says a spokesperson from the ministry. \u201cThis provision allows for indefinite contracts for public plans or programs, in accordance with certain conditions and with the full protection of the law.\u201d As for the problems of financing, ministry sources say that they are \u201cworking so that the State Research Agency can make the start dates for requests more flexible,\u201d thus avoiding periods without access to funding.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/01/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
