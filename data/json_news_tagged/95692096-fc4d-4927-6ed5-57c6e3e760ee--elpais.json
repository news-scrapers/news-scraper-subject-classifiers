The regional authorities are being accused of not bringing disciplinary action against the owners of the electricity cables and even obstructing the work of the environmental agencies that process complaints after finding the bodies of the birds.\n\u201cIt is truly a massacre,\u201d says Ernesto \u00c1lvarez, president of the Group for the Rehabilitation of Indigenous Fauna and its Habitat (Grefa), which is dealing on a daily basis with the issue as they monitor the electricity cables around the country.\nEsa\u00fa Escolar, vice president of the Spanish Association for Environmental and Forestry Agents (Aeafma), which does similar work in the region of Castile and Le\u00f3n, agrees, adding that the authorities \u201cthrow a lot of obstacles in the way\u201d when it comes to fining the owners of the power cables.\nThe missive sent last week to the regional authorities was drawn up by the Environment and Urban Planning Department\u2019s prosecutor, Antonio Vercher. The department opened a case on the matter in 2017. But, after several years asking the regional authorities for information, the conclusion has been that, \u201capart from admirable exceptions, it can be said that the authorities have not initiated competent disciplinary action to find out the potential legal significance of the death of bird life by electrocution or collision with the electricity cables.\u201d\nThe public prosecutor also points out that in order to justify the lack of action, some authorities have said that they consider these deaths to be accidents so, in their opinion, disciplinary action has not been an option. According to the document accessed by EL PA\u00cdS, others allege that the electricity companies have agreed to fix the defective cables, meaning they are unable to take disciplinary action.\nAccording to a report, 33,000 birds of prey die each year because of electricity wires\nHowever, the public prosecutor refutes these arguments and points out that in the province of Albacete, in the central Castile-La Mancha region, the authorities have brought disciplinary action in such cases and the courts have sided with them on six occasions.\nThe public prosecutor also refers to the lack of resources, both human and material, in the recovery centers, which say the number of birds killed by electrocution and collision is \u201calarmingly high.\u201d\nAccording to a report from the previous Environment Ministry, 33,000 birds of prey die each year because of electricity wires, while another study by the Friends of the Imperial Eagle Foundation put the total number of bird deaths between 192,000 and 337,000.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/06/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
