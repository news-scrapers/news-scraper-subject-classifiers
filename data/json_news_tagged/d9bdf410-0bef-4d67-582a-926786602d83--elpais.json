It is not known how many jobs could be lost or if personnel will be relocated to other bases. The meeting on Wednesday also failed in its goal to create a negotiating table for the first collective agreement.\nThe Irish airline says that the possible closures were announced in a plan on July 16, which warned\u00a0bases in underperforming airports would be shut down, either temporarily or permanently, from November due to the delay in the delivery of 30 Boeing 737 Max planes, which it expected to receive by the summer of 2020. Boeing, however, stopped deliveries of the model in March after the deadly plane crash in Ethiopia, which came just six months after a Boeing 737 Max crashed in Indonesia.\nAfter reporting a sharp fall in quarterly profits in July, Ryanair CEO Michael O\u2019Leary warned that the company would be forced to cut jobs at the end of September and after Christmas. According to O\u2019Leary, the airline has an excess of more than 500 pilots and about 400 cabin crew.\nGustavo Silva, the secretary general of USO-Ryanair, said: \u201cThis playing the victim over alleged losses is unjustifiable, when it is a business that is constantly increasing its profits.\u201d\nThe Spanish strike in September \u2013 the date is yet to be set \u2013 comes as Ryanair crew in the United Kingdom and Portugal also plan work stoppages. Portugal\u2019s cabin crew union SNVPAC has announced a strike between August 21 and 25, in response to news that the Ryanair base in Faro airport will be closed next year, which will result in 120 job cuts. UK-based pilots have also called a strike for August 22 and 23 and between September 2 and 4.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/08/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
