In April 2018, the CDR tampered with toll plazas in Catalonia, raising barriers to let vehicles through for free.\nThe detainees are part of the self-described Technical Response Team, viewed as the most violent faction of the CDR, according to sources familiar with the case. The suspects had purchased materials that could be used to make explosives, and had tested out home-made bombs at an isolated location, said the same sources. None of them has a criminal record.\nCivil Guard officers raided homes and commercial premises in the cities of Barcelona, Sabadell and Santa Perp\u00e8tua de Mogoda, where they seized material that could be used to make explosives, computer equipment and documents. One of the suspects was in possession of floor plans of several public buildings, judicial sources have confirmed.\nInside a home in Sabadell, officers found sulfuric acid, paraffin, aluminium powder, paint stripper and gasoline, as well as notes on how to use these ingredients to make bombs. There were also notes on the chemical components of Goma-2, a powerful industrial explosive that was regularly used by ETA in the 1980s and 1990s.\nInvestigators say they have acted against what could be the beginnings of a new terrorist group in Spain\nInvestigators say they have acted against what could be the beginnings of a new terrorist group in Spain, which endured four decades of violence by ETA, the Basque terror group that was formally dissolved last year.\nThe Barcelona arrests come shortly before Spain\u2019s Supreme Court hands down a widely anticipated decision on the fate of Catalan separatist leaders who were tried earlier this year for rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds in connection with the unilateral secession attempt of 2017.\nThe operation, which began at 5am and involved around 500 officers, was launched by an investigating judge at Spain\u2019s High Court, the Audiencia Nacional. Prosecutors are describing the suspects as \u201ca terrorist group\u201d and say it is \u201ccertain\u201d that they were planning to carry out actions \u201cbetween the anniversary of the illegal self-determination referendum of October 1 and the announcement of the [Supreme Court] decision.\u201d\nThe detainees are facing charges of rebellion, terrorism and keeping explosives, according to judicial sources. The case is under seal.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/23/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
