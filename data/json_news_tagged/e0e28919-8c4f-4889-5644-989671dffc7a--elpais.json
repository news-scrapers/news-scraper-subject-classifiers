The conservative Popular Party (PP) won 87 seats \u2013 a major gain from the 66 seats it secured in April, its worst result ever. But far-right group Vox saw the most significant rise, jumping from 24 to 52 seats, to become the third-largest party in Spain\u2019s lower house, the Congress of Deputies.\nUnidas Podemos \u2013 a coalition of the United Left and anti-austerity group Podemos \u2013 retained 35 of the 42 seats it won at the last election, while the center-right party Ciudadanos (Citizens) suffered a crushing defeat, losing more than 40 seats to be left with just 10.\nFor decades the PSOE and PP had taken turns in power, but the economic crisis spawned protest parties and Spanish politics have lately been defined by a lack of parliamentary majorities and the inability of politicians to reach governing deals. Sunday\u2019s vote was the fourth general election Spain has held in as many years.\nThe inconclusive results mean that Spain is facing more political uncertainty, as neither the left-wing or right-wing blocs have the 176 seats needed for an absolute majority in the 350-seat Congress. Ciudadanos\u2019 collapse and the rise of the PP and Vox have consolidated right-wing positions in Congress, while the center has become practically irrelevant.\nS\u00e1nchez has asked other parties for \u201cgenerosity\u201d to break the stalemate. \u201cOur goal is to form a stable government. We have won the elections. This time, no matter what, we are going to achieve a progressive government,\u201d he said on Sunday night. While S\u00e1nchez said he was reaching out to all political parties, he made a point of excluding \u201cthose that sow the rhetoric of hate,\u201d in a thinly veiled reference to Vox.\nAfter the results came in, Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera announced he would call an emergency meeting of the party\u2019s executive to discuss its future. \u201cWhat we have had today is an unmitigated bad result, without excuses,\u201d he said. On Monday morning, he announced his resignation as party chief.\nThe president of the PP, Pablo Casado, suggested on Sunday night that the caretaker PM should step down. \u201cS\u00e1nchez has lost his referendum, he is the big loser today,\u201d said Casado, who had earlier described this repeat election as a second round of the April 28 vote.\nMeanwhile, Vox leader Santiago Abascal celebrated the far-right group\u2019s result: \u201cEleven months ago we had no representation in any government institution,\u201d he told cheering, Spanish-flag-waving crowds. \u201cToday we are the third political force in Spain. [...] We have told the left that they have no moral superiority.\u201d\nPablo Iglesias, the leader of Unidas Podemos, said the repeat election had only served to \u201cstrengthen the right and turn the far right into one of the strongest in Europe.\u201d Iglesias called again for a coalition government between his party and the PSOE. \u201cWhat in April was an opportunity \u2013 a progressive coalition government \u2013 is now a necessity,\u201d he said, after the results were announced.\nJust one year ago, Spain was the only large country in Europe without a xenophobic party sitting in parliament.\nSupport for the far-right group appears to have soared in response to the violent protests in Barcelona that erupted in October after the Spanish Supreme Court sentenced nine Catalan separatists to prison for their involvement in the 2017 breakaway bid. The ruling led to major disturbances, with hundreds of people injured and more than \u20ac2.7 million in damage caused to public property.\nDuring a televised debate ahead of the election, Vox leader Abascal pledged to outlaw separatist parties \u2013 including the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) \u2013 and send Catalan premier Quim Torra to prison.\u00a0\nVox has also been a vocal critic of the recent exhumation of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco from the Valley of the Fallen. The party opposes the Historical Memory Law (which formally condemns the Franco regime), and has also campaigned against immigration and the gender violence law.\nDuring the election campaign, S\u00e1nchez and PP leader Pablo Casado competed to win over centrist voters disillusioned with Ciudadanos.\nCasado brought the PP back to the center after a shift to the right led the party to its worst-ever result in April.\nS\u00e1nchez, meanwhile, toughened his tone on the separatist movement in Catalonia, promising to criminalize the organization of illegal independence referendums, such as the one that took place in the breakaway region in October, 2017. This crime was introduced into the Spanish penal code by a conservative government in the early 2000s in response to a referendum proposal by the Basque Country, but it was later repealed by a Socialist administration.\nS\u00e1nchez won the highest amount of votes at the April 28 general election, but fell short of an absolute majority, meaning he needed the support of other parties to be sworn in as prime minister. But despite months of negotiations, the Socialist Party and its most-likely partner Unidas Podemos were unable to reach a governing deal.\nIn July, S\u00e1nchez offered Unidas Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias three ministerial positions and a deputy PM spot, in exchange for supporting his investiture bid. But Iglesias rejected the offer, claiming they were \u201cdecorative\u201d positions. After the failed investiture vote, the Socialist leader refused to negotiate a coalition with Unidas Podemos and pushed for a single-party executive.\nS\u00e1nchez called on Ciudadanos and the PP to abstain from a second investiture vote to break the political deadlock, but both parties refused. Indeed, Ciudadanos\u2019 months-long refusal to negotiate with S\u00e1nchez triggered resignations by four senior party officials who disagreed with party leader Albert Rivera\u2019s shift to the right, and led to a major drop in voter support.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/10/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
