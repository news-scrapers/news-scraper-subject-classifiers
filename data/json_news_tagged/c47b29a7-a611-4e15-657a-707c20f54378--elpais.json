Judge Manuel Garc\u00eda-Castell\u00f3n, of Spain\u2019s High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, made the decision on Thursday, arguing that the individuals belonged to a violent faction of the Committees to Defend the Republic (CDR), a network of grassroots activists who have made headlines in recent years through public acts of protest in support of the Catalan independence movement.\nThe seven detainees are facing charges of belonging to a terrorist group, possession of explosives and conspiracy to cause harm\nIn his writ, Garc\u00eda-Castell\u00f3n described this faction, dubbed the Technical Response Team (ERT), as an \u201corganization with a hierarchical structure, that aims to instate a Catalan republic via any means, even violent ones,\u201d according to judicial sources. \u201cThe ERT is an organization with sufficient capacity to carry out tactics and operations with a high level of professionalism,\u201d the court statement read.\nThe seven detainees are facing charges of belonging to a terrorist group, possession of explosives and conspiracy to cause harm. This is perhaps the most serious ruling to be made against Catalan separatists since several pro-independence political and social leaders were arrested in 2017 for their involvement in actions leading up to the illegal independence referendum on October 1 of that same year, and the unilateral declaration of independence that was passed a few weeks later.\nThe judge\u2019s decision comes as part of an investigation, launched by an investigating judge at Spain\u2019s High Court, into radical Catalan separatists who were allegedly planning acts of violence ahead of the second anniversary of the unauthorized independence referendum, and the Supreme Court\u2019s widely anticipated decision on the fate of Catalan separatist leaders who were tried earlier this year for rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds in connection with the unilateral secession attempt of 2017.\nOfficers discovered documents explaining the components needed to make homemade explosives\nAs part of the investigation, Civil Guard officers raided homes and commercial premises on Monday in the cities of Barcelona, Sabadell and Santa Perp\u00e8tua de Mogoda, in an operation dubbed \u201cOperation Judas.\u201d The swoop led to the arrest of nine people and the seizure of various materials that can be used to make explosives.\nIn Sabadell, Civil Guard officers found sulfuric acid, paraffin, aluminum powder, industrial paint stripper, gasoline and thermite, a pyrotechnic composition with great incendiary power. Officers also discovered documents explaining the components needed to make homemade explosives as well as Goma-2, a powerful industrial explosive that was regularly used by Basque terror group ETA in the 1980s and 1990s. Goma-2 cannot, however, be made with the materials seized. Two of the individuals arrested on Monday have confessed to making explosives and testing them, according to sources from the investigation. They were also found to have images of regional police stations and patrols on their cellphones.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/27/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
