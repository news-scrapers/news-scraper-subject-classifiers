He did not meet with the head of the Catalan government, the separatist Quim Torra, whose telephone calls to S\u00e1nchez last weekend went unanswered.\nThe crisis is not over, we will have to be persistent\nCaretaker PM Pedro S\u00e1nchez\nS\u00e1nchez has demanded from Torra an unequivocal condemnation of the street violence seen in Barcelona and other major Catalan cities throughout last week, in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to sentence nine separatist leaders to prison terms of up to 13 years over the unilateral breakaway attempt of 2017.\nS\u00e1nchez instead met with high-ranking officials of the National Police and later visited injured officers at Sagrat Cor and Sant Pau hospitals, where he was booed by some staff members. Hundreds of people have been injured in the weeklong clashes between protesters and the police.\nAccording to a government press release, S\u00e1nchez thanked the hospitalized policemen for their contribution to containing the \u201cpublic order crisis\u201d in Catalonia. He also said that \u201cgreat patience\u201d will be required. \u201cThe crisis is not over, we will have to be persistent.\u201d\nSeveral hundred independence supporters protested S\u00e1nchez\u2019s visit in front of the Spanish government\u2019s delegation headquarters in Barcelona, where they sat down with signs that read: \u201cSpain: sit and talk.\u201d The leaderless movement Democratic Tsunami, which is being investigated for its role in organizing last week\u2019s widespread protests, issued a message on Twitter showing images of the sit-in with the message: \u201cThe Spanish government was wondering who is behind the Tsunami. Today we made that clear: the same people who are in front.\u201d\n\ud83c\udf0a Aquesta \u00e9s #LaFor\u00e7aDeLaGent \ud83c\udf0aPedro S\u00e1nchez, that's your responsability: #SpainSitAndTalk\ud83c\udfa5 @eldiarioespic.twitter.com/pp2qn8KpyO\nS\u00e1nchez has sent Torra a letter urging him to condemn the violence of recent days. \u201cThe duty of any public official is to ensure the safety of all citizens [...] and preserve the social harmony. [...] In recent days, your behavior has been moving precisely in the opposite direction,\u201d reads the letter, which was made public on Monday morning.\nPablo Casado, the head of the opposition conservative Popular Party (PP), was also in Barcelona on Monday, where he met with the media and said that the criminal code should be updated to reflect the new forms of rebellion. \u201cWhat we have seen in this case of sedition that has recently been tried is that it took place from within the institutions, and not necessarily wielding weapons,\u201d he said.\nSpain will hold a fresh general election on November 10, the fourth in four years.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/21/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
