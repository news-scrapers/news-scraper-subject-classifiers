And then there\u2019s Javier Merino\u2019s bar. Thirty-five kilometers from the center of Madrid, south of the satellite town of Fuenlabrada, the 10,178 people living in Gri\u00f1\u00f3n voted overwhelmingly for the far-right party Vox at the November 10 repeat general election, giving it the highest share of the vote \u2013 32.6%, which is seven points more than at the April poll.\n\u201cWho should I vote for then, the same ones as always?\u201d asks Merino, a married man with a 12-year-old son, who has run the bar for eight years and lived in the area for 30. \u201cSeeing how badly the others have behaved, the normal thing to do is to vote for a new party,\u201d he adds. \u201cVox is saying what we all want to hear.\u201d\n\u201cI vote for Vox because of everything. We are tired of everything,\u201d says Noe Garc\u00eda, 43, while her father orders coffees and a glass of wine. \u201cThe least that can be expected of a party is that it puts the people of its own country first, before the rest.\u201d\nGarc\u00eda works in a gaming room, earns \u20ac1,200 a month, is married and has a 15-year-old daughter. \u201cShe has turned out to be left-leaning, but she still can\u2019t vote,\u201d she says, insisting, \u201cI am not racist or anything like it, but you have to sort your own country out first. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nWhile she takes a drink of her coffee, her mother Paloma, who was a cleaner until she retired, nods in agreement. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t like is that people move into houses and you can\u2019t throw them out, that\u2019s why I vote for Vox,\u201d she says.\nAsked whether she knows of anyone who has had squatters in their home, she replies: \u201cNo, but it\u2019s on the television every day.\u201d\nBilled as \u201cLa Moraleja of the south,\u201d in reference to one of Madrid\u2019s wealthiest areas, Gri\u00f1\u00f3n is in the increasingly wide belt of towns now controlled by the far right. Here, the annual household income ranges from \u20ac38,000 to \u20ac44,000. Three-quarters of the population are aged under 64, most are self-employed or working in the service sector, and many have moved here from other areas of Madrid or Toledo, buying their property during Spain\u2019s construction boom. They are, in short, the middle class that always wanted to aspire for more.\nTom\u00e1s Burgue\u00f1o, 66, a widower with two children aged 40 and 44, is enjoying a tinto de verano\u00a0 (red wine with soda) near the square. \u201cI\u2019ve always voted for the PP, but Rajoy didn\u2019t know anything,\u201d he says, in reference to the conservative Popular Party (PP) and its former prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, who was forced out of power last year by a no-confidence vote in the wake of a corruption scandal.. \u201cVox is new and we need something new. I like the proposal of getting rid of the autonomous regions and the worthless institutions that are only good for the lazy.\u201d\nWhen it is pointed out that Vox party leader Santiago Abascal used to run one of these institutions, he replies: \u201cAnd he left it after three months. When he saw what was going on, he got out.\u201d\nBurgue\u00f1o, who worked in customs, takes out his cellphone and opens a WhatsApp group to play a recording of a supposed immigrant saying that he has come to Spain so he can cash in on all the available social aid.\nWhen asked how he knows the voice belongs to an immigrant, he replies: \u201cBecause it is.\u201d\nSelf-employed until a few years ago, Pilar, 59, admits that she gets all her information and news from Facebook because the television bores her. \u201cI voted for Vox on Sunday for the first time,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have the Catalonia problem and nothing gets done,\u201d she says, in reference to the ongoing independence drive in the region. \u201cYou try breaking the law and you\u2019ll see what happens. I don\u2019t much like their ideas about women,\u201d she adds, in reference to Vox\u2019s policies, \u201cbut there are a ton of false gender-violence cases reported and all the vultures go after them.\u201d\nAccording to data from the public prosecution, more than one million gender-violence cases were reported between 2009 and 2016. Of these only 79 were false, in other words 0.0075%.\nWhen asked to specify what she means by \u201ca ton,\u201d she says: \u201cI know of one case.\u201d\nAdri\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, 18, exercised his right to vote for the first time on November 10. \u201cI voted for [PP candidate Pablo] Casado because Vox wants to take away rights,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of friends who voted for Abascal. They said they did it for fun, because it\u2019s fashionable.\u201d\nMart\u00ednez\u2019s friend, Alberto G\u00f3mez would have backed anti-austerity party Unidas Podemos if he wasn\u2019t still 17, and too young to vote. \u201cThe problem as I see it in this country is that now there is a fight to be the most Spanish, that\u2019s why Vox is winning,\u201d he says.\nIn another part of town, self-employed Luis de la Torre, 51, says that this is the second time he has voted for Vox. \u201cI am tired of [the crisis in] Catalonia and I believe that this lot will take a firmer line,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, his wife, Olivia, 46, an out-of-work hairdresser, says: \u201cI voted for the PP because I don\u2019t like what [Vox] says about women.\u201d\nLess than 7% of Gri\u00f1\u00f3n\u2019s population are immigrants. A number of locals say they don\u2019t want the Cercan\u00edas commuter train service in their town in case it attracts more. Ilhan Mohamed, 36, who was born in the Spanish North African exclave city of Melilla, and studied biology in Granada, is aware of the anti-immigrant attitudes among the locals. \u201cVox views immigrants negatively,\u201d she says a week after the election, while visiting her nephew\u2019s grave in Gri\u00f1\u00f3n\u2019s Muslim cemetery. \u201cA lot of people think that I am different because I wear a headscarf and have another religion. The other day, a man said to me, \u2018Now you\u2019re all coming and we don\u2019t have room to move.\u2019 It was an isolated case. But we\u2019ve got here because we have failed to respect ourselves.\u201d\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/19/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
