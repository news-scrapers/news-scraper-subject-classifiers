Then he walked into the family home and killed his mother-in-law and sister-in-law.\nA neighbor says Abet had been \u201cacting strangely\u201d\nThe crimes took place in the hamlet of Carracido, an administrative division of Valga, in Pontevedra province.\nAfterwards the suspect went back to his house in Bertamir\u00e1ns, in the municipality of Ames, around 20 kilometers from the scene of the crime.\nThe man then called the Civil Guard station and confessed to the killings. A source at the law enforcement agency said that the suspect was arrested at home and brought down to the station.\nThe couple were going through divorce proceedings. There are no records of domestic violence complaints.\nSources who were close to the victims said that Abet showed up early on Monday at the house that the couple had built for themselves when they got married. The husband had moved out when they split up.\nAlba Boquete Jamardo, 39, was getting ready to go to work when her ex showed up. Her sister Sandra, 27, and mother Mar\u00eda Elena, 59, were there to help her with the kids, as they usually did at this time of the day.\nAlba was standing outside the car, with the children inside the vehicle, when Abet approached her and shot her with a handgun, according to a reconstruction of events provided by Maica Larriba, a government official in Pontevedra.\nAfter killing his ex-wife, Abet walked into the property and shot the other two women.\nThe residents of this hamlet of around 40 homes heard the shots. One of them approached the scene of the crime and took the children to safety. A close relative has taken them in their care, said the mayor, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Bello, in statements to the news agency Europa Press.\nThe suspect owns a frozen food business and has a child from an earlier relationship. The neighbors said that the couple had been having problems for a couple of years, although nobody could say how long they had been separated.\nOne local resident said that in recent weeks Abet \u201chad been behaving very strangely and was getting along very poorly with the community.\u201d\nSources familiar with the investigation said that the suspect did not resist arrest when the Civil Guard showed up at the home that he was now sharing with his own mother and sister.\nThe murder weapon has not been found yet. Abet has no gun license and no criminal record. Investigators believe he may have obtained the weapon on the black market, which would suggest a premeditated crime.\nIn March, a 47-year-old man shot his wife and then committed suicide in this same municipality of Valga. So far this year, 40 women have been killed by their current or former partners. The tally since 2003, when records started being kept, is 1,015.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/16/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
