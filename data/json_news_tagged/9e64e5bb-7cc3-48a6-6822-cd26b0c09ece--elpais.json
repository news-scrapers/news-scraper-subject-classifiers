Finally, these groups banded together and waged war on him in what became known as the battle of Helik\u00e9 \u2013 possibly Elche in Alicante or Elche de la Sierra in Albacete \u2013 where Hamilcar met his death in 228BC.\nLast year, the archeologists and historians Mar\u00eda del Rosario Garc\u00eda Huerta, Francisco Javier Morales Herv\u00e1s and David Rodr\u00edguez Gonz\u00e1lez came to the end of their research after three years excavating and two years analyzing the remains of the Iberian necropolis of Alarcos, in the Spanish province of Ciudad Real, where they unearthed 25 tombs belonging to Iberian aristocrats, including one the experts believe could have belonged to a prince, from the period when Hamilcar was killed in battle.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the exact role of these particular Iberians in the events surrounding the Second Punic War,\u201d says David Rodr\u00edguez, a professor of prehistory at Castilla-La Mancha University. \u201cBut it is very tempting, although very unlikely, to imagine that they were with the Carthaginians or perhaps they were fighting alongside the Oretani king Orisos in Helik\u00e9, a city besieged by Hamilcar which various contingents of Oretani tried to liberate. But it can\u2019t be a coincidence that the majority of the richest tombs in the Alarcos necropolis ascribed to aristocratic warriors are from this precise period or after,\u201d he adds, explaining that this would be between the years 220 and 90 BC.\nTwo of the 25 tombs belonged to women who were buried along with their weapons and three stand out on account of the quantity and quality of the riches they contain \u2013 falcata swords, shields and spears, bits indicating horse ownership and luxurious items made from gold and silver and carnelian quartz, as well as evidence of the sacrifices made upon the death of their occupants. One of the tombs had 453 sheep talus bones, which required the sacrifice of 222 animals, according to experts\u2019 estimates. The bodies of the dead were burned and kept in pots that have been unearthed during the dig.\nAnother tomb could have belonged to a prince, judging from the massive blocks of stone employed in its construction complete with carved steps, though it was sacked long ago for its valuables. The rest of the tombs have been found to hold 327 objects, nine percent of which were fashioned from gold. Another tomb turned out to be a cenotaph, with no body in it as the warrior apparently died far from the settlement and his remains would have been hard to recover. Yet another contained the grave goods that would have corresponded to an aristocrat and a warrior.\nThe analysis has shown that there were notable differences among the tombs of the dead which have been classified into three different groups \u2013 wealthy, intermediate and simple \u2013 though all the belongings indicate an elevated status when compared to those found in different Iberian archeological digs on the peninsula from in the same cultural ambit, according to Rodr\u00edguez. What has amazed researchers is the lack of evidence of ordinary folk in the necropolis.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they did with the remains of these people,\u201d says Rodr\u00edguez. \u201cPerhaps they gave them a different kind of burial, such as throwing their bodies in the river, or something like that.\u201d Given that the population would have been over 1,000 over a period of five or six centuries, it is, as Rodr\u00edguez points out, a mystery.\nThe Alarcos site covers 33 hectares and sits on a 100-meter high hill. This, together with other natural defenses such as the Guadiana River, made it a good place to settle permanently. \u201cThe Alarcos necropolis has triggered a notable leap in our knowledge of Iberian burials, as we have been able to present a contextualized collection of tombs and materials which allow us to offer a more guaranteed definition of the Iberian burial ritual in general and the Oretani one in particular.\u201d\nIt is impossible to know for certain whether these warriors killed Hamiilcar, but, according to the Roman historian Appian, we do know how Hamilcar, the father of Hannibal, died. \u201cThe Iberian kings killed him in the following manner,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey took carts filled with logs pulled by oxen and these were followed by weapons. On seeing them, the Africans [Carthaginians] burst out laughing. But when they drew closer, the [Oritani] set fire to the carts and hurled them towards the enemy. The fire disconcerted the Africans. Having broken up their ranks, the Iberians killed Hamilcar and a great number of those who were defending him.\u201d\nPerhaps the prince in the tomb at Alarcos was the one who designed this successful strategy.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/12/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
