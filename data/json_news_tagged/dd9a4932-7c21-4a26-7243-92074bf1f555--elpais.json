He was 25 years old, spoke four languages and was only thinking about finishing his studies. Up until then, Ali Maray had what seemed like a normal life. But from one day to the next, it became more like a never-ending story. Maray was born near Homs in Syria, and was forced to flee the war that has been devastating the country for the last eight years. He moved to Sudan, escaped a coup in the African country last April, was cheated and mistreated in Libya, and then made the desperate decision to cross the Mediterranean Sea on a small boat in search for a better future.\nIf you didn\u2019t pay you were tortured with electric shocks\nAli Maray, rescued migrant\nMaray was shipwrecked and rescued by the Open Arms, the Barcelona-based rescue ship that was stranded for 20 days at sea. He was evacuated for severe seasickness a day before the vessel finally docked on Tuesday at the Italian port of Lampedusa. Recounting his story with a smile, Maray is committed to looking to the future: \u201cI never wanted to be a refugee. It is a hard word for me,\u201d he says in English.\nCrossing the Mediterranean was a desperate, last-minute option in Maray\u2019s journey. The turning point came when he became a legal adult in Syria, and the army and the paramilitaries tried to recruit him. He escaped by the skin of his teeth thanks to his study permit. The conflict came to dominate daily life in 2011: \u201cCan you imagine that people in this building start shooting at people in that building and at any moment you could be caught in the crossfire?\u201d he asks, pointing to two buildings in a street in the center of Lampedusa. A suicide attack left him unconscious in hospital for two weeks. On another occasion, two car bombs exploded in front of his sister\u2019s house \u201cin a neighborhood considered safe,\u201d in Homs. \u201cIn my city, I lost more than 25 friends and more than a hundred people I knew,\u201d he says.\nMaray decided to leave the hellish situation. He bought a plane ticket and moved to Sudan, \u201cthe only country where I didn\u2019t need a visa.\u201d He made the trip alone. His parents were old and his two siblings had children and chose not to follow him. He tried to continue his engineering studies in Sudan, he looked for university scholarships but didn\u2019t find any and began working as an electrician, from 8am to 6pm, and as a waiter. Things became complicated when the riots began, before the army staged a coup against the state and ousted the dictator Omar al Bashir. Someone recommended he escape to neighboring Libya, seemingly through legal means. \u201cI decided to knock on that door, look for work there or try to request asylum later in Canada,\u201d he says. Maray paid \u20ac800 to cross into Libya over land. \u201cWhen we arrived, they took our passports and put us in trucks, with no light, and brought us to Tripoli.\u201d\nMaray went to the Libyan capital to find his cousin. It was a hard journey that lasted almost five months. \u201cThe people who brought us beat people, they constantly asked us for money, and if you didn\u2019t pay you were tortured with electric shocks,\u201d says Maray. \u201cLife in Libya has no value, you are nobody.\u201d\nIn my city, I lost more than 25 friends and more than 100 people I knew\nAli Maray, rescued migrant\nHis cousin sold his house and invested all of his money crossing the Mediterranean and escaping the country. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I wold prefer to die one day at sea, than to die every day\u2019.\u201d They were promised water, food and a comfortable journey, but when Maray and his cousin boarded the precarious boat they were given nothing of the sort. \u201cAs we were leaving the coast, the waves became bigger and bigger, we began to lose gasoline and water started filling the boat. Then we saw the Open Arms: it scared me because I thought it was the Libyan coast guard,\u201d says Maray. He was completely exhausted by the time he was rescued: \u201cI collapsed. In 25 years I have used up the strength of an 80-year-old man.\u201d\nAs Maray talks to EL PA\u00cdS, it is announced that the Open Arms will be allowed to dock thanks to an order from the Agrigento public prosecutor. \u201cNow? Really?\u201d he asks, aware that resolving the crisis on the rescue boat was not on anyone\u2019s agenda. The decision from the Italian prosecutor, Luigi Patronaggio, came just as the Spanish Navy ship was on its way to Lampedusa to collect the migrants and bring them to Spain. \u201cWe have done it. We are here now,\u201d says Maray.\nOn Tuesday night, Proactiva Open Arms, which runs the Open Arms vessel, published a video showing the 83 migrants still on board celebrating the fact they would reach land in a matter of minutes. Maray looks for his cousin. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he will appear. He doesn\u2019t like the cameras,\u201d he says. Maray heads to the port to welcome his cousin and the others. When the large ship slowly appears on the horizon, he starts clapping, together with a small group of people who have come to the dock to welcome the Open Arms. While the boat moves in position to dock, the migrants on board spot Maray and yell his name. He takes out a cellphone from his pocket and films a video to send to the family of one of the young men, to let them know he is safe. \u201cAsk me now: now I am alive again,\u201d he says smiling.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/22/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
