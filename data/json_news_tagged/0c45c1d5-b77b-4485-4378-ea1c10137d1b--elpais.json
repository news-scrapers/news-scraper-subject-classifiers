After 18 years as an anti-drug prosecutor in C\u00e1diz, she is now become the first coordinating anti-drug prosecutor in Andalusia, which is the first region in Spain to establish such a role.\nVillag\u00f3mez was considered the perfect candidate for the complex job given her experience overseeing the special security plan in Campo de Gibraltar, in the south of Spain, which led to the seizure of 149 tons of drugs and 4,852 arrests in one year.\nQuestion: Why has this broader role been created?\nAnswer: The police and Civil Guard units going after the drug traffickers in Andalusia are carrying out investigations that affect M\u00e1laga, C\u00e1diz and Seville too because, although the organizations are based in Campo de Gibraltar, they are moving to other places to unload the drugs.\nThe violence continues and it is on the rise\nQ: Why the move?\nA: When they feel under pressure in one place, they try to change their routes and modus operandi. There was a time when the Guadalquivir River was a point of entry for the majority of the hashish shipments. When they came under pressure there, they kept moving until they became much stronger in Campo de Gibraltar. Now we are seeing them return to Guadalquivir and other areas in the provinces of C\u00e1diz, Almer\u00eda, Huelva and also in Portugal.\nQ: Does that mean there has been a further division of the drug trafficking spoils?\nA: The same drug traffickers who were operating in Campo de Gibraltar are shifting some of their infrastructure and contacting locals to help with the unloading.\nQ: Has the state been laissez-faire about this problem?\nA: Not exactly. It [the escalation] coincided with a period of intense crisis and I don\u2019t believe there was a lack of interest so much as a lack of capacity \u2013 so much so that it eventually it turned into a lawless territory.\nQ: Has the judicial system collapsed given that there are now more police operations?\nA: The situation in the courts in Campo de Gibraltar is not just down to that \u2013 there is also a huge backlog of work. The same thing is happening in other courts in the province, such as those in Barbate. They are already overloaded and these cases have exacerbated their collapse. But these proceedings are not confined to Campo de Gibraltar, they are also being carried out in Seville and M\u00e1laga. The police are mindful of not overloading the courts because it doesn\u2019t work. We are requesting more resources for the courts so that they are not so overwhelmed and can move forward.\nSmall children and young people are mixed up in the drug trade and their families who don\u2019t see anything wrong in it\nQ: Shootings, abductions\u2026 Your reports warn of the violence involved in drug trafficking. Has it been curtailed or is it as bad as it was?\nA: The violence continues and it is on the rise. They use weapons to ward off the police and other gangs when there is a settling of scores. The concentration of so many drug organizations in a specific area also attracts other gangs from outside who are keen to steal the merchandise.\nQ: Are you concerned about the corruption linked to trafficking, such as the case of the Civil Guard boss, Joaqu\u00edn Franco, who was busted in Algeciras for working with traffickers for more than 20 years?\nA: Very much so. It\u2019s important to keep the organizations under siege to prevent them from having the capacity and the money to bribe an officer of the law. At the end of the day, I think these are isolated cases.\nQ: What role does the Andalusian drug trafficker play in bringing hashish from Morocco into Europe?\nA: The gangs unload, guard and hand the drugs over to the buyers. They are not the bosses. In\u00a0 Campo de Gibraltar, they have taken things a step further and I believe that some are not merely involved in unloading operations.\nQ: Are you afraid that new drug lords will appear, like the Casta\u00f1a brothers?\nA: These people hold a certain appeal in the area, they are considered almost as idols. That is why it is important that the state and the justice system act as a deterrent and in prevention.\n\nPolice arrest infamous drug trafficker Antonio Tej\u00f3n Carrasco in June.\nQ: What should be done with the generations who have already been corrupted by the drug trade?\nA: It\u2019s very difficult to recover them. Small children and young people are mixed up in it and their families who don\u2019t see anything wrong in it. Punishment does not solve the problem of education.\nQ: Is there a risk that the local drug traffickers will turn to cocaine?\nA: It was said some years ago that they were trying to use the African hashish route for cocaine but we have not seen any sign of it.\nQ: What is the situation in Andalusia regarding other drugs?\nA: It\u2019s complicated. We have hashish and marijuana plantations that are spreading across the whole of Andalusia and small cocaine traffickers increasingly setting up shop in apartments which is generating a great deal of social alarm. Then there is the large-scale trafficking of cocaine that is coming into the port of Algeciras in containers.\nQ: The are an increasing number of successful operations in the port of Algeciras. Are authorities seizing more drugs?\nA: It\u2019s hard to know. You have to consider any conclusions drawn in light of the resources employed and whether those have increased. You can\u2019t draw a conclusion on the basis of one piece of data, it has to be viewed in connection to the rest.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/06/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
