What\u2019s more, the number of overdoses has risen over this period, from 700 a year at the beginning of the decade to more than a thousand in the last two recorded years. The overall rate has increased by 52%, but the rise has almost doubled among women. According to this data, more than two-thirds of women overdosed on opioids by accident, while the rest were intentional. The group most affected were men between 35 and 54 years of age and women over the age of 65.\nBetween 2010 and 2017, opioid use in Spain increased by 79%\nThis is the first time that data on opioid-related deaths (ORD) has been published in Spain. According to research from the Observatory that focused on cases between 2013 and 2016, ORDs are a \u201cproblem with serious social costs\u201d that \u201crequire special oversight.\u201d Like other similar international studies, the data is based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).\nProfessor Inmaculada Failde, the lead author of the study, says the goal of the research was to compare ORDs in Spain and the United States. According to Failde, based on these findings, it is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that Spain will see the same kind of opioid crisis as in the US, where the epidemic has been claiming more than 50,000 deaths a year. \u201cThe standardized death rates in the United States have been between eight and 12 times higher than in Spain,\u201d explains Failde.\nAccording to this expert, \u201cthe age groups most affected in almost all the cases were between 35 and 54, although there is a notable spike in the gross rate for people over 65.\u201d\nThe standardized death rates in the United States have been between eight and 12 times higher than in Spain\nProfessor Inmaculada Failde, lead author of study\nBut the research has no insight on why the overdose rate is higher among this age group. Failde explains this was not the goal of the study, and that the data itself does not shed light on the question. Nor are there any other studies in Spain that address this issue. But the Health Ministry and experts consulted by EL PA\u00cdS agree that the \u201caging population\u201d increases the likelihood of diseases that are treated with opioids. \u201cThe greater the use of opioids, the greater the risk of side effects, even the most serious ones,\u201d the experts warn.\nThe misuse of immediate-release fentanyl medicines is the most-cited cause of ORDs in middle-aged men. This form of the drug, which is taken via inhalers or administered directly under the tongue, immediately alleviates pain, but can also be very addictive, says Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngeles Canos, the head of the Pain Unit at the La Fe University in Valencia. Canos explains that these products are intended for cancer patients suffering intense and sudden pain, but when given to non-cancer patients, can lead the person to \u201cgive up their base treatment, and seek greater and more frequent doses than those that were prescribed.\u201d\nThe debate over the use of opioids is \u201cdelicate\u201d and \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d say most of the experts and public officials consulted by this newspaper. \u201cThere used to be fear and rejection towards treating pain. People were suffering unnecessarily,\u201d says Luis Sordo, who teaches at the Medicine School\u00a0 at Madrid\u2019s Complutense University. \u201cOf course there are things that need to be improved, but the fear now is that Spanish patients will end up paying for the mistakes of the United States.\u201d\nSpain is the seventh-biggest consumer of opioids and the fifth-biggest consumer of fentanyl formulations in Europe, according to a study by the Pharmacological Research Institute in Milan, based on data from 2014 to 2016. Germany is at the top of the list, although opioid use in that country is\u00a0 just about half what it is in the US.\nFailde says a system is needed to record the consequences and circumstances of opioid use so that \u201cunwarranted alarm\u201d does not lead to a fall in justified opioid prescriptions, and potential drug abuse by at-risk groups can be detected.\nCanos warns that prescriptions have \u201cincreased notably over the past years, in some cases far from the guidelines and with little patient oversight.\u201d But she rules out that the rise in opioid prescriptions recorded in Spain has come with a significant addiction problem.\nBetween 2010 and 2017, opioid use in Spain increased by 79%.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/23/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
