The cardboard manufacturing business Cartonajes Izquierdo cannot find anyone to fill a maintenance position or an IT role. And the logistics group Molinero is hoping to hire 150 truck drivers and forklift drivers, as well as administrative assistants and people who speak several languages.\nThe northern province of Soria is the most depopulated area in Spain, and one of the most deserted places in the whole of Europe. Businesses there desperately need workers, but cannot find them. The owners of these companies would like to attract more foreigners, but the legal paperwork makes hiring them difficult. Even more so if they are undocumented migrants.\nWearing a white work coat, Teo Mart\u00ednez walks proudly around the cold rooms of La Hoguera, where two million chorizo sausages are cured every year. The factory, located in the village of San Pedro Manrique, which has just 600 residents, would have had trouble surviving had it not been for migrant workers such as Abderrazak Salhi and Desislava Tsvetanova. These two earn \u20ac1,100 after tax a month and they live in the village with their families. \u201cWithout them, we would have to move to the city, which is just what we don\u2019t want,\u201d says Mart\u00ednez.\nThe family business has 96 workers on its payroll, 46% of whom are foreigners. \u201cI think there is a lack of information,\u201d says his wife Alba Abelleiro, who manages the company\u2019s human resources. \u201cI refuse to believe that with an unemployment rate of 14%, there are no Spaniards who want to work here.\u201d\n\u201cThe lack of workers has never been so staggering,\u201d says the president of Soria\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, Alberto Santamar\u00eda, who has asked for help from the Secretary of State for Migration. The Chamber of Commerce estimates that 1,700 workers will be needed three years from now, and they are worried that some companies will have to close or put their expansion plans on hold.\nMeanwhile, business owners have come up with a proposal that is unlikely to be taken on board; they want undocumented migrants already in Spain to get legal status via work contracts. \u201cThey are an asset and we would be solving two problems at once; taking them out of the shadows and solving our lack of workers,\u201d says Santamar\u00eda.\nBut the law forces undocumented migrants to live without residency or work permits for a minimum of three years before they can be awarded legal status, even if they are offered a job. What\u2019s more, the caretaker Socialist Party (PSOE) government is not in favor of \u201crewarding\u201d illegal immigration.\nSoria, with its 88,600 inhabitants, boasts a good quality of life and work-life balance. Locals go home for lunch instead of eating out of a Tupperware container at work. And children walk to school. Unemployment is around 8%, but the young people from the province go elsewhere to study and work. Soria has a shortage of roads, fiber optic broadband, housing, rail transportation, investment and plans for the future. It is the province with the second-lowest number of migrants. It\u2019s not easy to attract workers and their families here, and the system doesn\u2019t make it any easier.\nAbelleiro from La Hoguera has plenty of stories about interviewing candidates sent from regional employment offices across Spain. \u201cMost of those who turn up here are not really interested in the position; the filters are failing,\u201d she says. \u201cThere have been cases where we have asked for a cold cuts specialist and were sent a secretary from a cookie factory. Another time, we had 46 candidates but only two actually wanted the job. One was a convict whose hours didn\u2019t suit, and the other started to insult his wife as soon as he was seated.\u201d\nThe state employment office should, in theory, identify candidates who are suitable among the unemployed not just in Spain, but across the EU. But businesses complain that the system doesn\u2019t work in practice. \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of time,\u201d says Pilar Fern\u00e1ndez from Cartonajes Izquierdo. \u201cMy heart sinks every time I have to resort to it.\u201d\nBut companies have to show that they have used the state employment service before looking for workers from countries outside the EU. Businesses need to certify that there are no Spaniards or foreigners with legal status in Spain suitable for the job. Once a candidate has been located thousands of kilometers away, the hiring process can take more than six months. There is an easier route that entails far less bureaucracy: foreigners based in their own countries can be employed via the Catalogue of Difficult-to-Cover Jobs. This is how soccer players and coaches are brought in, but according to official figures, just 34 workers have been employed in the whole of Spain this year via this route.\nThe lack of workers is also affecting the health system. In the next two years, Soria will need around 13 doctors, from gynecologists to pediatricians, according to a list drawn up by Luis L\u00e1zaro, the head of human resources at Soria\u2019s healthcare department. \u201cThere has always been a demand,\u201d he says. \u201cI have spent 30 years looking for anesthetists.\u201d L\u00e1zaro has candidates close to hand but he is unable to take them on. For example, Jos\u00e9 Noguera and Henry Salinas are doctors from Venezuela who have 20 years of experience and are keen to live and work in Soria. \u201cWe have found here the peace that we needed,\u201d says Noguera.\nTheir specialties are neonatology and intensive care and they are on L\u00e1zaro\u2019s list, but although they have applied for asylum and have the right to work, the pair have been waiting for 18 months for the Science Ministry to certify their medical qualifications.\nThis is the usual time span for other professions, although it should be shorter for doctors, according to the Science Ministry. \u201cThere are channels that you have to go through, and I understand that you have to wait,\u201d says Noguera. \u201cBut it feels like a long time.\u201d\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/14/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
