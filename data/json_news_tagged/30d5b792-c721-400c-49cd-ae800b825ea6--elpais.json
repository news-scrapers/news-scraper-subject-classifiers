However, the last warning to be issued from the British Embassy about safety was related to political protests in the Catalonia region.\nThe French Consulate has also omitted to issue a warning with regard to rising crime in Barcelona this summer, though it has a list of basic recommendations on its webpage, such as keeping an eye on valuables, watching out for pickpockets on public transport and being particularly careful in popular tourist areas such as Las Ramblas and the Gothic quarter.\nMeanwhile, Japan produced a pamphlet last year for its nationals, flagging up the Sagrada Familia basilica and the Park G\u00fcell as trouble spots. Japanese visitors were also warned not to leave belongings on benches when taking photos, to avoid carrying items of value in back pockets and not to trust anyone who approaches to clean a supposed ketchup or chocolate stain on clothes \u2013 a scam that allows the partner in crime of the supposed Good Samaritan to relieve the tourist of his belongings while distracted.\nThe BBC highlights a number of violent thefts that have been reported in recent days\nThe US embassy warning has come in the wake of coverage by a number of European media outlets, such as the BBC and the German magazine Der Spiegel, which have focused on a crime wave in the Catalan capital this summer.\nThe BBC highlights a number of violent thefts that have been reported in recent days, including one involving the Afghan ambassador to Spain, Moassod Khalili, who last Sunday was knocked to the ground close to a central metro station by a group of delinquents who stole his watch.\nDer Spiegel described Barcelona in their report as \u201ccrime city\u201d and mentioned a number of cases, including that of the Afghan ambassador, a tourist who was punched repeatedly when having their watch stolen, and the death of a high-ranking South Korean official who succumbed to her injuries after falling to the ground when thieves tried to steal her handbag.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/23/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
