After Rosal\u00eda\u2019s concert at Primavera Sound in June, the fans of the Barcelona-born singer described her as a \u201cgoddess,\u201d while her detractors complained: \u201cshe did the same thing in Coachella,\u201d \u201cshe was so unlikeable,\u201d and \u201cI preferred her when she wasn't a marketing product.\u201d These judgments are three drops in the tsunami of public opinion against Rosal\u00eda, a phenomenon that has grown as the singer has become increasingly successful.\nRosal\u00eda has been criticized for singing flamenco when she is not a Gypsy, as though she were wearing \u201ca costume\u201d that can be put on or off taken off at will. In a message on Twitter, Gypsy activist Noelia Cort\u00e9s told Rosal\u00eda: \u201cI can\u2019t stand that you have more opportunities than Gypsy women who have been singing about their roots since they were children.\u201d She\u2019s also been accused of desecrating the tradition of pure flamenco (the famous flamenco singer, Camar\u00f3n de la Isla, received a similar criticism in the early 1980s). And when the 25-year-old singer won two Latin Grammys in 2018, she was attacked for not mentioning \u201cthe repression suffered by the Catalan people,\u201d in reference to the Catalan independence movement and the separatist leaders in custody for their involvement in the 2017 secession push. Indeed, Quim Torra, the regional premier of Catalonia and a hard-line supporter of the independence movement, refused to congratulate the singer.\nTo those who have criticized her for not defending the independence drive, Rosal\u00eda has said she \u201cwould like to have more knowledge to express an opinion on such a delicate subject, my opinion is not more important than anyone else\u2019s.\u201d To those who have accused her of cultural appropriation, she has pointed to her academic studies, while admitting her privileged position and wishing that her success would bring greater visibility to Gypsy artists.\nBut the controversies surrounding Rosal\u00eda go beyond her stance on the Catalan independence movement and have even led to sub-controversies. For instance, when the Association of Feminist Gypsies for Diversity accused her of making the Los Chunguitos song Me Quedo Contigo sound less \u201cGypsy,\u201d many criticized the organization for being sexist, arguing that it was unfair to attack Rosal\u00eda and not male singers like Antonio Vega or French-Spanish musician Manu Chao who have also performed covers of the song.\nRosal\u00eda has become the center of a cultural war that has been raging on social networks, in bars and between friends for years. Those who claim to hate Rosal\u00eda are not content to just complain that they do not like her music, they want to knock the singer off her pedestal and convince her fans they are wrong about her This offensive strategy often means skipping over the fact that Rosal\u00eda spent 18 months independently composing, producing and mixing her album \u201cEl Mal Querer,\u201d and it was only after the response to the songs Malamente and Pienso en T\u00fa Mir\u00e1 (she paid to make the video clips for both tracks) that Sony offered her a contract. Rosal\u00eda haters are also missing something very obvious: when a song is successful, it is simply because it is liked by a lot of people. While some argue that the Spanish media has exaggerated her success in the United States, the facts back her up.\nRosal\u00eda has performed in three international music festivals: Coachella, Glastonbury and Lollapalooza. She contributed to the soundtrack of the hit series Game of Thrones, and has also worked with international stars like Pharrell Williams, Billie Eilish and Dua Lipa. Former US president Barack Obama included her song Con Altura in his summer playlist, and it is rumored that Rosal\u00eda will record a song with Beyonc\u00e9. But there are still people who think it is all hype. As though Rosal\u00eda could fool The New York Times which called her \u201cthe Rihanna of flamenco\u201d in an in-depth profile. Denying the international success of Rosalia is like believing the Earth is flat.\nMost of her critics are missing a party to which everyone is invited. Rosal\u00eda has a song to meet all tastes \u2013 be it flamenco, Latin or urban. Those who refuse to enjoy her music are forgetting that it is better to dance than to hate. At the end of the day, her fans do not care that other people criticize the singer. What\u2019s more, even people who do not like Rosal\u00eda are not going to miss one of her performances. Her success is undeniable.\nEnglish version by Alicia Kember.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/12/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
