The last one, on April 28, was won by the Socialist Party (PSOE) but the party fell short of an overall majority and has been struggling to form a government.\nProlonged talks with the leftist Unidas Podemos (UP) failed to produce the required parliamentary numbers, as the latter pushed for a coalition government and dismissed as insufficient S\u00e1nchez\u2019s offer of a few socially-oriented Cabinet positions.\nOnly five percent of PSOE and UP voters support a fresh election in November as a way out of the stalemate. But if an agreement is not reached by September 23, parliament will be automatically dissolved and new elections called, following Spanish legislation.\nIn the meantime, S\u00e1nchez is now trying to convince UP to accept a single-party PSOE government with a shared program but no Cabinet positions for the anti-austerity group.\nOnly five percent of PSOE and UP voters support a fresh election in November\nThe Socialist leader has sent a letter to grassroots party members with his plans to prevent a new election. S\u00e1nchez wants a \u201cPortuguese-style\u201d government, alluding to the leftist alliance supporting the government of the Socialist Ant\u00f3nio Costa in Portugal.\nFor now, Podemos is rejecting this idea and insisting on a coalition government reflecting the party\u2019s parliamentary presence: 42 lawmakers in the 350-seat house, making it the fourth force in Congress after the PSOE, the Popular Party (PP) and Ciudadanos (Citizens).\nInstead of scheduling new talks with Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias, S\u00e1nchez has decided to meet \u201cwith different civil society groups such as feminist and environmental associations, social agents and third-sector groups so they can contribute to the creation of a common space in order to reach a progressive government,\u201d says the letter.\nThe survey, conducted between July 27 and 29, shows that 79.6% of Unidas Podemos voters support a coalition government with the PSOE. Only 32% of Socialist voters back that option, while 32.8% want Unidas Podemos to support a Socialist government without getting any Cabinet positions in return.\nA further 29.4% of PSOE voters would prefer to do without Podemos altogether and secure an abstention from the Popular Party (PP) or Ciudadanos (Citizens). That is what the PSOE did in 2016 to allow Mariano Rajoy of the PP to form a government and avoid a new election.\nBut 64.1% of PP voters think that new polls are the best option, while 52.2% of Ciudadanos supporters feel the same way. This percentage soars to 79.9% among sympathizers of the far-right Vox.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/01/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
