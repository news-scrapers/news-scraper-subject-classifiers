They are increasing the sense of insecurity and using tactics that are bordering on criminal offenses.\u201d That was what a spokesperson from the Catalan regional police force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, told EL PA\u00cdS this week.\nSociety is fed up and that\u2019s why we are getting increasingly organized\nEliana Guerrero, founder of Patrulla Ciudadana\nAs crime rates continue to soar in Barcelona, citizen patrol groups have taken the initiative in a bid to stop suspected thieves operating on the city\u2019s subway system.\nThis week, five uniformed members of the self-styled Barcelona Guardian Angels began patrolling the Metro. The group is modeled after the New York Guardian Angels, a controversial volunteer crime-prevention organization that was created in the Bronx at the end of the 1970s, which has since been deployed in several countries. The Guardian Angels style themselves as a kind of not-for-profit, self-organizing group of citizens, trained primarily in martial arts, who fight for justice at their own cost and risk.\nThe Barcelona Guardian Angels are a splinter group from Patrulla Ciudadana (Citizen Patrol), another self-organized crime-busting operation that reached peak popularity in July. This organization is run by Eliana Guerrero, a 47-year-old real estate agent from Colombia who began patrolling the Barcelona subway system 12 years ago, whistle and pepper spray in hand.\nIn response to the group\u2019s growing popularity, Barcelona\u2019s recently named head of security, Albert Batlle, said in June that he would seek to stop the citizen patrols. \u201cThe responsibility for security, public order and social harmony ordinance falls to City Hall, we can\u2019t have self-organized groups. It\u2019s extremely dangerous,\u201d he said.\nBut Guerrero insisted on Tuesday that Patrulla Ciudadana is as active as ever, with 50 members of the group patrolling Barcelona\u2019s Metro system every day. The Catalan police deny this, arguing that officers stop members of citizen patrols when they spot them on security cameras.\nThe so-called citizen patrols who go after pickpockets on the Metro are not doing any good\nCatalan regional police spokesperson\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to blame the people that we have had to organize. Why don\u2019t they put all that energy toward fighting pickpockets?\u201d asked Guerrero. \u201cSociety is fed up and that\u2019s why we are getting increasingly organized.\u201d\nThe Barcelona Guardian Angels are headed by Nicole Orlando, a 41-year-old woman who was born in New York and has lived in Barcelona for 13 years. She says she started the group after falling out with Guerrero.\n\u201cI have a box with mementos from my country. In it, there is a card from the Guardian Angels. I remembered them and after some disagreements with Eliana [Guerrero], I contacted the leader, Curtis Sliwa,\u201d Orlando said on Tuesday.\nThe Barcelona Guardian Angels have five members, and each wears a red beret, white shirt with the logo of the organization and black pants with large pockets. It\u2019s a paramilitary look. The group is made up of Orlando, who goes by the name \u201cKiddo\u201d when she is on patrol; \u201cRio,\u201d a young woman from the Philippines; \u201cSarge,\u201d a former policeman from England; \u201cIce,\u201d who is Scottish; and \u0090\u201cSifu,\u201d the only member who was born in Catalonia, and who is in charge of teaching the group martial arts. They have done self-defense courses and trained in a method designed by Sliwa, the guru and founder of the Guardian Angels.\nIn July, Tito \u00c1lvarez, a former labor union spokesperson who gained public prominence in Barcelona during the taxi sector\u2019s strikes over ride-hailing services such as Uber, also joined Guerrero in the fight against crime with an initiative called Salvalona, which he described as a \u201ccitizen movement\u201d to \u201cchannel\u201d popular unhappiness with crime rates in the city. \u00c1lvarez supports \u201cpeople organizing in patrols so that tourists are not robbed\u201d but is against the neighborhood groups that have been protesting against insecurity, claiming they are organized by members of the Committees for the Defense of the Republic (CDR), a self-organized, pro-Catalan independence group responsible for a series of disruptive actions in the region.\nMeanwhile, Orlando said she has not made any \u201carrests\u201d yet, but if she does catch a thief \u201cred-handed,\u201d she will detain them and call the police.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/19/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
