She doesn\u2019t sing in English, she doesn\u2019t use Swedish producers, she hasn\u2019t had to sing with British or US stars, and she hasn\u2019t gone to live in Miami.\nRosal\u00eda is a global idol with more than 731,000 Twitter followers on Twitter and more than 6.5 million Instagram followers\nRosal\u00eda is the biggest pop sensation from Spain this century and with such intense fame comes controversy. But she should feel proud of the stir she has created; these debates are helping the Spanish music industry to grow up.\nIt has gone from talking about the relationship between reality TV singing stars David Bisbal and Chenoa to arguing about cultural appropriation, a debate that artists such as Beyonc\u00e9 have spent years embroiled in in the United States, but that have never been an issue within the more modest Spanish music scene until now.\nRosal\u00eda shouldn\u2019t only be recognized for her Latin Grammys or her rave reviews in the New York Times, or for the fact she has had five number ones in Spain in less than a year. She should also be recognized for the fact that her controversies, and even her mistakes if that\u2019s what they were, have prompted the Spanish music industry to up its game in terms of quality, reach and debate.\nAfter the November 10 general election in Spain, the people who received the most comments on social media were Spain\u2019s caretaker Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Popular Party leader Pablo Casado, Ciudadanos chief Albert Rivera, and Rosal\u00eda. It was a tweet with just two words that caused the controversy \u2013 \u201cFuck Vox.\u201d The message in reference to the Spanish far-right party \u2013 which won 52 seats at Sunday\u2019s poll \u2013 is just what would be expected from a young woman with forward-thinking politics. After all, 62% of Vox voters are men over the age of 40. Except that Rosal\u00eda is not just anyone. She\u2019s a global idol with more than 731,000 followers on Twitter and more than 6.5 million followers on Instagram.\nFuck vox\nSpanish artists generally avoid taking a political stance. In an increasingly polarized society, no one is keen to lose thousands of fans from the other side. Who can forget the fallout when indie singer Russian Red declared she was right-wing when pressed by Marie Claire magazine in 2011? Or when Spanish singer Mai Meneses from the band Nena Daconte took part in an anti-abortion festival? Both singers were criticized by their fans and, despite being applauded by some for their honesty, never quite recovered.\nSaying \u201cFuck Vox\u201d is safer terrain. Far-right ideology is not something any global artist would want to be associated with. True, Vox has its own \u201csupporting\u201d celebrities but they are more along the lines of the comedian Ar\u00e9valo and 58-year-old singer Jos\u00e9 Manuel Soto.\nVox\u2019s response was swift but sounded outdated. Once again, the right accusing someone on the left for having money. In its reply message to the singer\u2019s Twitter message, the far-right party posted a photo of Rosal\u00eda flying in a private plane with the caption: \u201cOnly millionaires with private planes like you can afford the luxury of not having a motherland.\u201d It is an almost word-for-word the same phrase used by Ramiro Ledesmam, the co-founder of Spain\u2019s fascist-inspired political party Falange.\nSpeaking of the motherland, the first big controversy surrounding Rosal\u00eda was over cultural appropriation. Her first record \u201cLos \u00c1ngeles in 2017\u201d was rated best album of the year by many media outlets. This prompted the purists of the southern Andalusian region \u2013 the birthplace of flamenco \u2013 to ask what a girl from the Baix Llobregat neighborhood in Barcelona was doing releasing the most successful flamenco album of the year. \u201cI know where flamenco comes from,\u201d she told EL PA\u00cdS in 2018. \u201cI have studied an entire degree on it. The flamenco experts have tried to explain its origins. It is the product of a mix of cultures. It owes much to the gypsy culture but music doesn\u2019t have an owner.\u201d\nAs she also explained to EL PA\u00cdS, Rosal\u00eda grew up listening to Supertramp and Bob Dylan at home, and as a teenager began to devour everything from flamenco icon La Ni\u00f1a de los Peines to US hip-hop star Missy Elliott. This range of influences would prove significant for her second album, \u201cEl Mal Querer,\u201d whose songs and music videos took Spain by storm.\nIt was also a headache for Rosal\u00eda. This time the criticism came from Gypsy activists such as Noelia Cort\u00e9s. In a message on Twitter, Cort\u00e9s wrote: \u201cI can\u2019t stand that you have more opportunities than the gypsies who have been singing since they were little girls about their roots, it is as though a paya [outsider] who had singing classes is worth more than a gypsy who sings lyrics that tell her story and that of her people.\u201d\ny de verdad me duele, nos duele, si nos aprecias intenta dar voz a nuestro pueblo y no pisarnos y llevarte las flores t\u00fa.porque maldita la hora en la que dicen que tu flamenco sabe a sangre... me supera.tu flamenco, que no lo es, sabe a pesta\u00f1as postizas y a paya randaora.\n\u201cAnd it really hurts me, hurts us, if you appreciate us, try to give our community a voice and don\u2019t step on us and take the bouquets for yourself. Because it\u2019s bad news when they say that your flamenco tastes of blood\u2026 it\u2019s beyond me. Your flamenco, which isn\u2019t [flamenco] tastes of fake eyelashes.\u201d\nRosal\u00eda is not just criticized for the flamenco influence in her songs and pronunciation, but also for the imagery in her videos, which includes saints, trucks, bulls, jewelry, false nails, outdoor drinking sessions known as botellones in Spanish, and hooded Nazarenes or penitents. \u201cFrom your privileged race and background you can dress as though you were from a poor, marginalized district without having to experience the suffering of those who do live in those circumstances,\u201d said Cort\u00e9s.\nRosal\u00eda shot back a reply from the pages of Billboard magazine: \u201cI come from a generation that was born into globalization and the internet. That has changed everything. I never think of music as \u2018Is this correct or incorrect?\u2019 I always think: \u2018Is this exciting or not?\u2019\u201d\nOnce this controversy seemed to blow over, Rosal\u00eda ran into a new one: was she Latin or not?\nIf Latin music is music made in Spanish, then my music is part of Latin music\nRosal\u00eda\nThe question was raised after Rosal\u00eda won the Best Latin Video for the song Con Altura \u2013 her biggest international number to date with more than one billion hits on YouTube \u2013 at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards. Why would Rosal\u00eda be awarded a Latin prize if she was from Europe? The Catalan singer responded in an interview with The Fader music magazine: \u201cIf Latin music is music made in Spanish, then my music is part of Latin music,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do know that if I say I\u2019m a Latina artist, that\u2019s not correct, is it? I\u2019m part of a generation that\u2019s making music in Spanish. So, I don\u2019t know \u2013 in that sense, I\u2019d prefer for others to decide if I\u2019m included in that, no?\u201d\nThe Catalan rumba Fucking Money Man, released in June, 2019, seemed to be an area where she could safely sing without offending anyone; here was a Catalan artist, singing in Catalan in a genre traditional to Barcelona. She did it at a time when the Catalan language and Catalonia in general were at the top of the Spanish political agenda. She might even have been accused of being militant; the most famous Spanish artist in the world starts to sing in Catalan at almost the same time as the court case against Catalan separatist leaders for their involvement in the 2017 breakaway bid was coming to a close. But no. It was the Catalan language purists who took issue with her this time, criticizing her for using Spanish versions of Catalan words.\n\u201cThe singer has some linguistic errors,\u201d Gabriel Babilonias, professor at the Baleares Islands University told the Spanish newspaper El Peri\u00f3dico. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t harm the language too much as nowadays everyone knows that cumpleanys [instead of aniversari for birthday] and bautitzo [instead of batejo for \u2018I baptize\u2019] are gross Spanish-isms that almost no one says.\u201d\nFucking Money Man could also work as a headline to the many articles written about Rosal\u00eda\u2019s supposed concert fee. The controversy broke out after the Socialist (PSOE) mayor of Valladolid \u00d3scar Puente said in a message on Twitter that Rosal\u00eda was \u201casking \u20ac500,000\u201d to perform in the northwestern Spanish city.\nPide 500.000 \u20ac. T\u00fa me dir\u00e1s.\n\u201cAre we giving up on inviting Rosal\u00eda? She is asking \u20ac500,000. You tell me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat they are saying about our asking price for the show is false,\u201d was Rosal\u00eda\u2019s response. Puente insisted: \u201cAfter keeping us waiting for two months, her agent told us they would start talking to us from \u20ac500,000.\u201d Several months later, Rosal\u00eda performed in C\u00f3rdoba for \u20ac217,000. The fee may seem high if you don\u2019t take into the scale of the production and the dozens of people needed to set it up.\nJust three months later, US pop star Madonna weighed in, giving credence to Puente\u2019s version of events. Speaking in London last June, she said she loved Rosal\u00eda and had tried to get her to perform for her 60th birthday bash in Morocco. \u201cWhen she and I got in touch, it seemed like an easy transaction,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we needed was a guitar player and some palmeros [flamenco clappers]. But then a manager appeared, then an agent [\u2026] and then there were five people involved who wanted to charge an extraordinary amount of money. Then they told me that Rosal\u00eda\u2019s team would be formed by 36 people and I kept thinking, \u2018What?\u2019 So, it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/18/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
