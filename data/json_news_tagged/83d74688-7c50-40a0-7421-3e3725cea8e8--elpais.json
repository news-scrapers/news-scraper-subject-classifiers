All eight pages were suspended after this newspaper tried to reach him for comment.\nSources at the PP said they did not know about the existence of these pages. \u201cWe are not aware of this. We will not do online advertising until the start of the election campaign period,\u201d said one party source, who was unable to explain how a young university graduate such as Ager Solano could have spent tens of thousands of euros on the ads.\nThe ads combine aggressive publicity with messages in support of the PP. The leaders of the PSOE and Ciudadanos, Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Albert Rivera respectively, are the targets of the biggest criticism. In one, a speech by Rivera is followed by the classic quote by Groucho Marx: \u201cThose are my principles, and if you don\u2019t like them, I\u2019ve got others,\u201d in reference to Rivera\u2019s decision to lift his \u201cveto\u201d on doing deals with the Socialist Party.\nOne of the pages managed by Ager is titled \u201cYo no voto\u201d (I\u2019m not voting), and uses videos with visual elements and the message: \u201c10-N No cont\u00e9is conmigo,\u201d or November 10, count me out.\nIn two of the pages, named \u201cRecuperar el PSOE\u201c (Recovering the PSOE) and \u201cContrapoder\u201d (Counterpower), there are ads that were paid for by someone named Javier Francisco Barralo Vicente. An online search for that name turns up no results, and the email address provided on Facebook belongs to the domain name of another website with alleged ties to the Association for the Defense of the Interests of Spain (ADIES).\nADIES has run ads on its own Facebook page with messages that also criticize the PP\u2019s political rivals. One ad has the slogan \u201cWhat type of Pedro S\u00e1nchez are you today?\u201d and highlights statements by the caretaker prime minister that appear contradictory when taken out of context.\nA representative of ADIES told this newspaper that the association is not seeking votes for any particular party. \u201cThis is not something that is tied to the elections. We want to have permanent campaigns,\u201d said Manuel Onrubia, a 41-year-old computer expert. \u201cThere are lots of issues that will continue to be of concern to people: Catalonia, Brexit.\u201d Onrubia did not respond to the question of whether Ager and Barralo have any ties.\nAfter being contacted by EL PA\u00cdS, Facebook has opened an internal investigation. \u201cThanks for calling this to our attention. We are looking into it,\u201d said a Facebook spokeswoman.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/30/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
