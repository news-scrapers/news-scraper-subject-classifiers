But there are other Hollywood actors who prefer the charm of a traditional Spanish village to the glitz and glamor of these hotspots.\nMel Gibson, one of the biggest and best-paid actors of the 1990s, is a fan of Spain\u2019s northern towns. He has been seen in Santo Domingo de la Calzada, a municipality in La Rioja, and later in Oviedo in Asturias, where he told a local reporter from the regional television station that the area was \u201cmarvelous.\u201d The Hollywood star was happy to have his photo taken with admirers and locals. The actor was then seen eating at a local restaurant in A Fonsagrada in Lugo, and later in Santiago de Compostela, where he visited the cathedral and stayed in the historic Hostal dos Reis Cat\u00f3licos.\nOlivia Newton-John, the star of Grease who sold over 100 million albums thanks to hits like Physical, traveled to Ribeira Sacra in the middle of July. This area is located between the provinces of Lugo and Ourense in the northwestern region of Galicia, and it is famous for its wines, in particular Ferreira de Pant\u00f3n. On her trip, she ate octopus, took photos and posed next to a sign advertising \u201cclams, cheese and bacon.\u201d\nBack in 2007, former Hollywood power couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie got lost on their way to the Marqu\u00e9s de Riscal winery and found themselves in Castrejana, a neighborhood in the Basque city of Bilbao with no historical or tourist attractions. A photo of the stars with a street sweeper who gave them directions was picked up by newspapers and circulated among locals. The couple eventually made it to the famous vineyard in La Rioja, a region which has also attracted celebrities like Ken Follett, Gwyneth Paltrow, Eva Longoria and Amanda Hearst.\nThe Shakespeare in Love star stayed in Talavera de la Reina as an exchange student when she was a teenager. She has since kept in close contact with her exchange family and revisited the town. In 2003, the Hollywood star, who speaks fluent Spanish, was given the keys to Talavera de la Reina. When locals protested for more measures and greater investment in the area in 2018, Paltrow shared a video on social media in support of the cause.\nBlockbuster star Chris Hemsworth has a close relationship with Spain. He is married to the Spanish actress Elsa Pataky, and while the couple live in Australia with their children, they regularly visit the country. They\u2019ve been seen in the streets of Madrid and the clear waters of Ibiza, but also in Getaria, a coastal village in Gipuzkoa in the Basque Country, where Pataky\u2019s brother Christian Prieto got married in July 2018.\nThe comedy actress, famous for her punchy stand-up routines and roles in films like I Feel Pretty and Trainwreck, has not only traveled to Spain\u2019s villages, in her 2016 memoir The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo she named one of them as he favorite place in the world outside of the United States \u2013 Altea in Alicante. She even said she would move to the small town if Donald Trump won the US presidential election, a promise she is yet to act on.\nIn 1989, the actor traveled to Ponte Maceira, Costa da Morte and A Coru\u00f1a as a guest of Chema Prado, who was then the director of the state-owned film archive Filmoteca Espa\u00f1ola. He returned a decade later, with Prado and the Spanish actor Javier Bardem. In the spring of 2019, he went back again and dined at the restaurant Casa Salvador in A Ba\u00f1a with Spanish actress Marisa Paredes. He has promised to return again.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/15/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
