As part of this strategy, S\u00e1nchez has been meeting with women\u2019s associations, environmental groups, organizations that fight against depopulation and education activists. But Unidas Podemos remains suspicious. Unidas Podemos lawmaker Pablo Echenique wrote in a message on Twitter: \u201cEither I keep 100% of power, with 20% of the votes and 35% of the seats, or I take Spain to new elections. This continues to be the last ultimatum-threat of Pedro S\u00e1nchez. All the rest is just decoration.\u201d\nIf S\u00e1nchez fails to be invested at a second potential vote in September, Spain will head toward fresh elections in November. It would be the fourth time that Spaniards have been called to the polls to choose a government in four years, and the fifth election held this year alone.\nThe PSOE has called on the right-wing Popular Party (PP) and center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) to abstain from the investiture vote to break the political deadlock, but both parties have refused. What\u2019s more, on Monday, PP secretary general, Teodoro Garc\u00eda Ege, said PSOE should abstain to allow the PP and Ciudadanos to lead a coalition government headed by PP leader Pablo Casado. \u201cAs the only problem Spain has in forming a government is that no one trusts Pedro S\u00e1nchez \u2013 not even Podemos, or Pablo Iglesias trust him, a space should be made for another candidate,\u201d he said.\nHis comments came a day after the King of Spain, Felipe VI, stated: \u201cIt would be best to find a solution before going to elections.\u201d\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/07/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
