Nine of the defendants received prison sentences for sedition and misuse of public funds.\nPonsat\u00ed fled to Scotland after the unilateral independence declaration of October 2017\nBritish authorities consider that the crime of sedition under UK law can also be considered a crime against public order, which carries a less serious sentence.\nIn its first communication, Britain\u2019s SIRENE (Supplementary Information Request at the National Entries) office, which aims to ensure police cooperation between EU member states, said that the EAW had been reviewed by a specialist UK lawyer on behalf of the National Crime Agency and they had determined that it was \u201cdisproportionate under UK law.\u201d\nBut Reuters reported that in a message on Twitter on Wednesday night, Spain\u2019s caretaker Foreign Minister Josep Borrell explained that British police had \u201ccorrected their use of the term disproportionate\u201d to refer to Ponsat\u00ed's extradition request.\nIn his message, Borrell shared a copy of the new communication from SIRENE which stated: \u201cIn our previous message our reply incorrectly stated that the warrant was disproportionate \u2013 it is not disproportionate, it is just currently lacking in essential information. We apologize for this miscommunication.\u201d\nIn the document, British police request more information regarding the nature of the offense, the time and place at which it was committed, and the connection between the offense and Ponsat\u00ed.\nThe EAW will remain on hold until this \u201cessential information\" is provided.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/07/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
