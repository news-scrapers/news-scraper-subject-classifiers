The former skier was identified through her clothes and footwear.\nOchoa, the first Spanish woman to win a winter Olympic medal, had been reported missing on August 24. The search effort to find her was the biggest ever organized in the Madrid region, with more than 200 law enforcement officers, helicopters, drones, horses and tracking dogs.\nThe cause of death will be officially determined by forensic toxicology testing that could take weeks. A preliminary autopsy has been conducted and the conclusions are expected soon.\nThe police reported that the body of the 56-year-old was located on the mountain peak of La Pe\u00f1ota, near Cercedilla, a mountain town with strong ties to the Ochoa family. She was last seen alive on August 24, first at an Hipercor supermarket in Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n, and later in Cercedilla where a local resident saw her headed for the area where she was found on Wednesday.\nHer relatives began to worry when she failed to come home and did not get in touch. She had also left her cellphone behind.\nFern\u00e1ndez Ochoa had recently moved in with her sister and brother-in-law after getting divorced from her second husband and selling the family home in the Madrid municipality Las Rozas. Her two children, Olivia and David, were living with their father.\nAfter ending her career, she had taken up other sports such as golf, and participated in a few reality shows on television. Most recently she had been making a living as a personal trainer, like her sister Lola, but her financial situation was described by family members as \u201cvery precarious.\u201d\nThe skier\u2019s relatives have informed the mayor of Cercedilla that they wish to hold the wake there. The town is home to a monument to her brother, Francisco \u201cPaquito\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa, honoring his achievements at the Sapporo Games of 1972. Cercedilla is also where Blanca was carried aloft by a jubilant crowd after she won bronze in the slalom at the Albertville Games in 1992.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/05/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
