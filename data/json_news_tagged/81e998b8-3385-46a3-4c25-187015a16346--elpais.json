Firefighters responded to more than a thousand call outs, most of them for minor issues such as fallen tree branches or flooding in garages and basements. Spain\u2019s meteorological agency AEMET recorded more than 9,300 lightning strikes in six hours.\nThe municipality hardest hit by the storm was Arganda del Rey, located to the southeast of the capital, and where the hail fell particularly hard. The city is in a natural hollow, with mountains on either side, which contributed to flash flooding in three of its main streets. The water was so strong that parked cars and street furniture were swept away by the current.\nDuring the extreme weather event, which lasted 20 minutes, the Socialist Party (PSOE) mayor of Arganda del Rey, Pedro Guillermo Hita T\u00e9llez, wrote on Twitter: \u201cTrying to stabilize the situation and give an account of urgent requirements. The flash flood has been terrible. All services are working at full capacity to normalize [the situation]. Be alert to instructions.\u201d On Tuesday, the city council will open an office for locals to assess the damage caused by the storm.\nHours before the storm, AEMET issued an orange alert for rain and storms, indicating a significant risk. As well as Arganda del Rey, the other areas most affected by the storm were Valdemoro, Pinto, Rivas, Getafe, Fuenlabrada and Madrid city, emergency services told EL PA\u00cdS.\nAccording to meteorologist Benito Fuentes, strong storms such as these ones are common in August. \u201cThe rain has been fairly heavy but it is not unusual for this time of the year. At the end of summer, the atmosphere is unstable, which causes air to rise for dynamic reasons, not thermal ones. This leads to quite strong rainfall and storms,\u201d he told EL PA\u00cdS by phone.\nThe heavy rain led to traffic jams, with many lanes blocked. Early on Tuesday morning, emergency services warned that there were road blockages on the M-220 at kilometers 19 and 22, serious problems on the M-506 at kilometer 19, and a lane cut off on the M-40 beltway at kilometer 30.\nAccess to the Ventisquero de la Condesa tunnel from the inner carriageway of the M-30 was also blocked, according to Madrid\u2019s Mobility Management Center.\nThe storm also wreaked havoc on Madrid\u2019s Metro underground rail network, with numerous suspensions. The connection between Pueblo Nuevo and Cartagena on Line 7 was suspended in both directions due to problems at the stations, as was the service between Arg\u00fcelles and Alto de Extremadura on Line 6. There were also delays of more than an hour on Line 5, and more than 30 minutes on other lines. Services continue to be suspended in both directions between the stations of Arganda del Rey and La Poveda on Line 9. The rest of the lines are now working normally, according to Madrid Metro.\nFlights from London, Turin, Bolonia and Doha, scheduled to land in Madrid-Barajas airport at midnight were forced to divert because of the storm and land at an alternative airport, according to air controllers.\nThis is the first weather crisis to happen under Madrid\u2019s new regional premier, the conservative Popular Party\u2019s Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, who was sworn into office two weeks ago thanks to support from the center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) and far-right Vox. During the storm, Ayuso wrote on Twitter that she was in contact with the mayors of Arganda del Rey, Getafe and Madrid.\nWeather conditions will return to normal on Tuesday in Madrid region according to AEMET, which has issued a special warning for showers and heavy storms in the east of the peninsula and the Balearic Islands.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/27/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
