The protest was called by a civic group called Societat Civil Catalana (SCC) under the slogan: \u201cFor understanding, for Catalonia: Enough!\u201d in reference to the street unrest that was seen in Barcelona after the Supreme Court found the separatist leaders guilty of sedition on October 14.\nTo protest the ruling, pro-independence groups held week-long demonstrations that, while peaceful during the day, descended into violence at night, with protesters clashing with police, torching cars and setting up barricades. According to Barcelona City Hall, the unrest caused \u20ac2.7 million in damage.\nDuring Sunday\u2019s march, the president of the SCC, Fernando S\u00e1nchez Costa, read out a declaration that stated: \u201cWe will never accept or tolerate violence, neither symbolic violence, much less real violence. The streets are and will be for everyone, not for those who use intimidation to take them.\u201d\nIn his speech, S\u00e1nchez Costa called for the resignation of Catalan premier Quim Torra, who has been criticized for his response to the violent protests. \u201cTorra, if you do not know how to govern, if you are not going to govern for all Catalans [not just those who support independence], if you prefer to be an activist, it\u2019s very simple: let\u2019s go to the polls,\u201d he said.\nWe will never accept or tolerate violence\nSCC president Fernando S\u00e1nchez Costa\nMeanwhile, during the march, one protester argued: \u201cThey are trying to make something that is not normal seem normal,\u201d while others chanted: \u201cHere the press don\u2019t have to wear helmets,\u201d in reference to the violent pro-independence protests. Other protesters held signs with more conciliatory messages such as: \u201cI can\u2019t choose between Mom and Dad, nor can I between Catalonia and Spain.\u201d\nSunday\u2019s march against the Catalan independence movement was attended by the leader of the conservative Popular Party (PP), Pablo Casado; the head of the center-right party Ciudadanos (Citizens), Albert Rivera; and two ministers from the caretaker government of the Socialist Party (PSOE), Josep Borrell and Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos. While they had not been invited, the far-right party Vox also took part in Sunday\u2019s demonstration.\nThe situation in Catalonia is shaping up to be a key issue ahead of the general election on November 10. The PP and Ciudadanos are looking to boost voter support by attacking Spain\u2019s caretaker Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez for his handling of the crisis, and positioning themselves as the defenders of Spanish unity. Government sources confess that every sign of disturbance in Catalonia is a mark against S\u00e1nchez.\nThe march on Sunday came a day after hundreds of thousands of pro-independence supporters held a largely peaceful protest in Barcelona. According to the municipal police, 350,000 people came out to join the protest \u2013 which is the lowest turnout for a pro-independence rally in the last eight years.\nAfter the daytime march, many of the protesters headed toward the headquarters of the National Police for a demonstration organized by the pro-independence protest group, the Committees to Defend the Republic (CDR). There were more scenes of tension as protesters clashed with riot police, who fired foam bullets at the crowd. Three people were arrested in the protest.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/28/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
