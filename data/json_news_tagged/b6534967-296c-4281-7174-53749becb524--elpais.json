One of the works included inside her cartoon project is Abueland, a series of illustrations about how we often offload childcare to grandparents. \u201cI started, like all mothers, to think and realize that not everything was rosy,\u201d she explains via a telephone conversation. \u201cMy parents went out of their way for my son, who was their first grandchild, they were really happy. But when I had my second, I realized they were exhausted.\n\u201cSometimes I would watch grandparents talking in the park. And they would say, \u2018I\u2019m exhausted, but I don\u2019t want to say no to my children.\u2019\u201d Are we denying this \u201cSlave Grandparent Syndrome?\u201d For Navarro, that\u2019s the case. And although Spanish society is aware of this problem, it\u2019s not clear enough.\nThere are many forms of social criticism. \u201cI decided to do it through humor, because it\u2019s an easy and direct way to ensure that people will think about this,\u201d says Navarro, whose ambition is \u201cto put a face and, why not, a smile to a real and complex situation.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my way of criticizing the lack of work-life balance not only suffered by parents or businesses, but also endured, albeit often with a smiling face, by grandparents,\u201d she explains.\nThe following cartoons come with comments by the author.\nThe \u2018Super Granny\u2019\nThere they are, putting the needs of others above their own. Without giving it a second thought, they fly to wherever their timely assistance is needed, or to cover impossible schedules of childcare. They would never say it out loud, because we assume that that\u2019s what they\u2019re supposed to do, but their exhaustion is evident in the dark circles under their eyes and in their joy at seeing us come through the door to pick up the little ones. They are the base of the iceberg that supports a model of work and life that is incompatible with parenting. And this, unless you look closely, often goes unnoticed.\n- Dad, when you go to town, please put the child safety seat on your bike\n- Yes, of course darling\nThe new forms of parenting coexist with the traditional ways of the generations that came before us. Finding the right balance is not always easy. We ask them to take care of our children, but not in any old way: in our way. Abueland captures these situations with the goal of self-critique through humor and to find common ground between fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, who sometimes grow apart for these kind of reasons.\nWater aerobics\nGrandparents are still occupied with the little ones during their own leisure activities.\nAfter-school activities\nAt 7pm, whether in biodance or mindfulness classes for children, you can always find grandparents giving it their all.\nAnd one marvelous point in common... Opposites attract\nChildhood and old age are the two poles of life, and in spite of their tremendous distance, they\u2019re so similar! Their calm pace and availability of time are two common elements. In contrast to the frantic pace of life prevailing in our society, their slower rhythm allows them to stop, observe details in silence and enjoy simple, everyday things.\nEnglish version by Alicia Kember.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/28/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
