They had never heard of such a case. What started with a British tourist running barefoot through the southern Spanish city of M\u00e1laga, ended with the unexpected arrest of a 76-year-old woman with a long criminal history. Once caught, Josefa (fictitious name), with her missing teeth and disheveled appearance, feigned confusion: \u201cWhere am I? What am I doing at the police station?\u201d she asked the officers from the robbery unit of the National Police.\nShe would ask staff, very timidly, if it was possible to rent the apartments\nPolice officer\nThe act almost fooled the officers. Perhaps she had Alzheimer's disease and got lost. But when they took her fingerprints, they were shocked: Josefa had been arrested 40 times under eight different names since the 1970s. \u201cShe almost got away with it,\u201d said one officer from the National Police.\nThe police operation, codenamed \u201cNet Curtain,\u201d began in a luxury apartment in the historic center of M\u00e1laga on September 19. A family of tourists from Manchester had rented the apartment for their vacation. While they were on the balcony, they saw a woman \u2013 Josefa \u2013 open the door to the property with her own key and try to steal from them. One of the tourists yelled out and ran after her, without stopping to put on his shoes. He chased her downstairs and down the nearby streets, but had trouble catching up with her. \u201cThe man was strong and athletic but she managed to dodge him,\u201d said one of the local police officers who helped the tourist. He was barefoot, sweating and agitated. \u201cAnother drunk tourist,\u201d the police originally thought.\nThe man gestured for the police to come with him. A few meters away, in Los M\u00e1rtires square, several members of his family had caught Josefa. \u201cA very old-looking woman,\u201d said Rafael J., an officer from the M\u00e1laga local police force. \u201cWe found it very strange, but we could tell something odd was going on,\u201d said\u00a0municipal officer Ram\u00f3n. The officers thought the woman was just disorientated. She was wearing humble, dark clothing, as if in mourning, her hair was disheveled, and she looked as if she wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly.\nBut the person in charge of the business that rented out the apartment insisted that she had been caught inside the property. The officers went up to the luxurious home, and agreed it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for her to have been there by accident. Josefa was then taken into custody at the provincial police station, where despite her convincing performance, officers were able to uncover her long criminal history.\nThe members of the Robbery Unit did not know of the woman, but the different district police stations did. She was living in the heart of La Palmilla, one of the most impoverished neighborhoods of M\u00e1laga, and was an expert in fooling and cheating others. She has been a thief \u201call her life\u201d \u2013 be it robbery or petty theft, but always stealing from properties. She has been in and out of prison several times.\nShe almost got away with it\nPolice officer\nAs she was fleeing from the tourist, Josefa dropped two sets of keys (there were 20). These keys opened the front doors to tourist and residential apartment buildings, all owned by the same company. The Robbery Unit had a few unsolved cases in the same area and decided to investigate further. The cleaning and maintenance workers remembered her. \u201cShe would ask them, very timidly, if it was possible to rent apartments there or something else,\u201d said one of the officers. They also revised the security footage. Some of it had been lost but one of the blocks still had the recordings.\nIn the footage that EL PA\u00cdS has had access to, Josefa is seen checking that there is no one on the stairs and calling the lift for floor she is planning to steal from. That way, she made sure she had a minute to enter the apartments and take the first thing she could find: computers, phones, bags, cash. In one case, she stole \u20ac1,000. On October 11, officers stopped her again to charge her for at least three more robberies. A judge has sent her to prison, and the National Police are now investigating how she made copies of the keys to the tourist apartments.\nHer modus operandi allowed her to steal periodically: most tourists don\u2019t report robberies, and no one believes those who do, thinking that they just want to claim insurance. No one changes the locks and, a few days later, there\u2019s new tenants with new loot. At 76, Josefa knew what she\u2019s doing.\nEnglish version by Alicia Kember\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/25/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
