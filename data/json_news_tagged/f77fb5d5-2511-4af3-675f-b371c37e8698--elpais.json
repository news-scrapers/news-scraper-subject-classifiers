Not only was the Barcelona-born singer the first female Spanish artist to win an award at the event (one for Best Latin Video, another for Best Choreography), her live performance became a world trending topic on social media.\nSo how did Rosal\u00eda get to this point? Let\u2019s take a look at the highlights from the past year that have turned the Spanish singer into an international phenomenon.\nThe British pianist and TV host Jools Holland is known for being one of the first to spot international music stars. In mid-October last year, before Rosal\u00eda presented her new album \u201cEl Mal Querer\u201d at a massive concert in C\u00f3lon square in Madrid, she was invited to perform on the BBC show Later...with Jools Holland.\nThe program, which has been running for 27 years, brings together around five artists to sing live in front of a studio audience. Rosal\u00eda performed Malamente and Pienso en tu mir\u00e1 during an episode that also featured performances by Norwegian singer Sigrid and Paul Weller, the legendary former frontman of The Jam. The complete show can be seen in Spain on Movistar+.\nRosal\u00eda was invited to perform two songs (De aqu\u00ed no sales and Malamente) at the MTV Europe Music Awards at the Bizkaia Arena in Bilbao, in Basque Country. As well as sharing the stage with Nicki Minaj and Janet Jackson, the Spanish pop star was also nominated for the award for best Spanish act, which she lost to indie group Viva Suecia.\nShe may have missed out on a prize at the MTV Europe Music Awards, but at the Latin Grammys, Rosal\u00eda was awarded Best Urban Fusion/Performance and Best Alternative song for Malamante. The singer was also asked to perform at the event and put on a dramatic show, dressed in a Palomo Spain outfit with Gucci sneakers that would set the stage for her performance at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n#Malamente. @rosaliavt en acci\u00f3n\ud83d\ude0d.

Speechless.\nRosal\u00eda\u2019s first international collaboration was with Colombian reggaeton star J Balvin on the song Con Altura. Since its release in March 2019, the music video has received 776 million views on YouTube, and was even the subject of analysis by The New York Times.\nRosal\u00eda\u2019s first performance at an international music festival was at Lollapalooza in Argentina. She performed at the festival in Chile two days later, and again in Chicago in August. To date, the singer has performed in several countries including the United States, Mexico, Canada, Denmark, France, Poland and the Czech Republic.\nThe singer\u2019s entrance in the English-speaking music world came via a duet with British singer James Blake. The song Barefoot in the Park, which mixes English and Spanish, paved Rosal\u00eda\u2019s path toward becoming an international electro-pop sensation.\nCoachella, one of the most important festivals in the world, brought Rosal\u00eda to California. In one of her several weekend performances, the Catalan star paid tribute to flamenco duo Las Grecas with a version of the song Te estoy amando locamente. At the Goya Awards, Rosal\u00eda also performed a song by Spanish Romani group Los Chunguitos.\nAs\u00ed es como @rosaliavt llev\u00f3 a Las Grecas a @coachella pic.twitter.com/s0BsDovhdQ\nRosal\u00eda bring Las Grecas to Coachella.\nRosal\u00eda has also won over the iconic US magazine Billboard. In April, she performed at the Latin edition of the Billboard Music Awards, performing a song medley with J Balvin, El Guincho and Sean Paul.\nRosal\u00eda made a small cameo appearance in Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s film Pain and Glory, which was premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. The movie has since been released in more than 20 countries, including Argentina, France, Uruguay and Australia.\nFor her latest single Yo x Ti, T\u00fa x M\u00ed, Rosal\u00eda teamed up with Puerto Rican music star Ozuno. Since its release two weeks ago, the music video has received 50 million views on YouTube and is threatening to overtake the success of Con Altura.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/30/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
