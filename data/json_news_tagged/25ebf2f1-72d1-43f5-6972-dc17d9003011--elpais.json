The caretaker PM is refusing to submit to another vote unless he is guaranteed the support he needs, and the deadline for dissolving parliament is next Monday at midnight.\nPSOE strategists feel that their party will no longer be able to attract many more voters from the leftist Unidas Podemos group, and they have now set their sights on the more progressive followers of Ciudadanos, who could number around a million people.\nSome sources in the PSOE, however, are skeptical about this plan and believe that many disgruntled Ciudadanos voters will simply abstain instead of switching allegiances.\nBut party leaders believe that there are many opportunities to be found in Catalonia, Ciudadanos\u2019 home region and the place where this party started to grow on an anti-separatist message. \u201cThere are a lot of borderline voters there who once voted for us, and we think we can bring them back by defending dialogue [with Catalan nationalist leaders] within the bounds of the Constitution,\u201d said one source in the PSOE leadership.\nThe PSOE sees itself as an attractive alternative for non-separatist Catalans who oppose Unidas Podemos\u2019s calls for a legal referendum, but who fall short of supporting Ciudadanos\u2019 insistence on reintroducing direct rule by Madrid.\nMeanwhile, PP leader Pablo Casado is continuing to cultivate his moderate public persona as he strives to win back the conservative voters who switched to Ciudadanos and Vox on April 28, when the PP lost a massive 71 seats from the previous election.\nPodemos is still undecided as to whether it should attack the PSOE or use moderate rhetoric, considering that its goal remains a coalition government, and that the Socialists are their only possible partners.\nAnd Albert Rivera, who steered Ciudadanos toward the right in a move that has triggered internal criticism and the resignation of several party leaders \u2013 including Francesc de Carreras, considered the party\u2019s \u201cintellectual father\u201d \u2013 will now have to decide which flank to focus on to contain the probable loss of votes.\nDuring question time in Congress on Wednesday, Pedro S\u00e1nchez gave an indication of what his new strategy will look like in the coming weeks. Even fellow Socialists were startled at the tough tone that the caretaker PM used with Gabriel Rufi\u00e1n, a representative of the Catalan Republican Left (ERC), a separatist party that helped him win a no-confidence vote against the previous PP administration last year.\nS\u00e1nchez said that he would not hesitate to reintroduce direct rule in Catalonia through the application of Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, if there were \u201cany attempt\u201d by the Catalan regional government to \u201cviolate\u201d the nation\u2019s highest law as it did during the failed secession attempt in 2017.\nHis attitude underscored how S\u00e1nchez is seeking to appeal to non-separatist Catalans who may be unhappy with their voting options. But Pablo Sim\u00f3n, a political scientist who teaches at Madrid\u2019s Carlos III University, warns that this is a risky strategy. \u201cIn the worst scenario for the PSOE after November 10, they could need an affirmative vote from ERC to get [S\u00e1nchez] confirmed; an abstention might not be good enough.\u201d\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/19/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
