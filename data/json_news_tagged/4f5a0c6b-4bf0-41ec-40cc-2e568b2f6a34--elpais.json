The body was discovered early on Wednesday at the beach in Caldes d\u2019Estrac, in Barcelona province.\nThe emergency services are currently searching for four more people reported missing: a mother and her son in Vilaverd (Conca de Barber\u00e0), whose prefabricated bungalow was swept away by floodwaters, and two more people in l\u2019Espluga de Francol\u00ed (Tarragona). In the latter municipality, two bridges were swept away after the River Francol\u00ed burst its banks, as well as the Rend\u00e9 Masdeu winery and a restaurant, both of which were located on the banks of the waterway. A young girl sustained minor injuries in the Barcelona municipality of Gualba as a result of the extreme weather conditions.\nThere have been travel disruptions as a result of the bad weather in northeastern Spain, with train services suspended between the Barcelona municipality of L\u2019Hospitalet and Salou in Tarragona, affecting the R16 line and long-distance services, among others.\nWednesday also saw disruption to the Barcelona Metro system, with the green line not making stops at the Paral\u00b7lel station on its way to Zona Universitaria. The red line (L1) was suspended between Espanya and Gl\u00f2ries and the L9 between La Sagrera and Can Peixauet.\nFlooding also caused a series of roads to be closed, with 43 separate incidents across the Catalonia region.\nAround 20,000 people were left without electricity today in Catalonia, 5,000 of them in Cambrils, Tarragona, according to the Civil Protection service, which received around 2,700 emergency calls this morning. Regional premier Quim Torra has announced that he will visit the affected areas on Wednesday.\nTarragona province was one of the worst affected by the heavy rains, with a red weather alert raised by the AEMET national meteorology agency. The rainfall reached an intensity of up to 200 mm during the night, causing flooding and damage.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/23/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
