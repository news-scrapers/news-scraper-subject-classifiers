Quezada, who confessed to the killing last year after she was apprehended by police with the body of the youngster in the trunk of her car, only took questions from her own lawyer and the prosecutor on Tuesday. She was first asked by the judge, Alejandra Dodero, whether she pleaded guilty or innocent of the charges she is facing, of premeditated murder and psychological damage to the parents of the child. \u201cInnocent,\u201d she replied.\nI wanted them to apprehend me. I couldn\u2019t deal with it any more\nAna Julia Quezada\nQuezada \u2013 who at times spoke through sobs, at others raised her voice, and often interrupted herself to ask forgiveness for her crime \u2013 has changed her version of the events of February 27, 2018, when she killed the eight-year-old son of her then-partner, \u00c1ngel Cruz, in the Andalusian village of Rodalquilar. She has also changed her account of the 11-day search for the child, in which she actively participated, and the circumstance of her arrest. The nine members of the jury heard two new elements in the case yesterday: that Quezada wanted to kill herself, and that she planted a shirt belonging to the child during the search efforts because she wanted to get caught.\n\u201cI wanted them to find me,\u201d she told the court. \u201cI wanted them to apprehend me. I couldn\u2019t deal with it any more.\u201d\nThe prosecutor, meanwhile, pointed out that during the investigative stage of the case, Quezada had told the judge in charge of the probe that she had planted the item of clothing \u201cbecause she wanted to give hope\u201d to Gabriel\u2019s father.\nIn groups of three, the members of the jury had to come close to an audio player to clearly hear a recording from a device that had been planted by police in Quezada\u2019s car. \u201cLet\u2019s see what I am going to do with you,\u201d she is heard to have said on March 11, with the body of Gabriel in the trunk of her vehicle, shortly before her arrest. \u201cWhere shall I take you? To a greenhouse.\u201d\nBut according to her testimony in court on Tuesday, she was actually planning on taking the child to the garage of the property in the Almer\u00eda municipality of V\u00edcar where she lived with Gabriel\u2019s father. Quezada was, she told the court, planning to \u201cgo home and write two letters,\u201d one for \u00c1ngel, her partner, and another for her daughter, explaining what had happened.\n\u201cI wanted to say sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to leave my dog in the kitchen with water and food and the door of the terrace open. And to grab all the medication that I had, take it all and lie down on the sofa.\u201d\nDid you search for a video about the 10 most poisonous plants?\nElena Fern\u00e1ndez, prosecutor\nQuestioned by the public prosecutor, Quezada recounted what happened on the day that Gabriel died. When they arrived at the family property in Rodalquilar that they were renovating, the child began to play with an ax.\n\u201cI said to him, \u2018Put it down, you could hurt yourself.\u2019 He started to shout, \u2018You don\u2019t tell me what to do, you\u2019re not my mother. You\u2019re black, you\u2019re ugly, you\u2019ve got an ugly nose, I don\u2019t want you to be with my father. I want my father to marry my mother. I want you to go back to your country.\u2019 He was shouting all of that stuff. I just covered up his mouth, I didn\u2019t want to hurt the child. I just wanted him to shut up. I didn\u2019t want to kill the child.\u201d At that moment during her testimony, Quezada became very upset, and began to sob. Shortly beforehand, she said that Gabriel was a polite child, with whom she had not had any problems. Another witness, the psychologist Francisco Mart\u00edn, noted that the child was\u00a0\u201cparticularly well-behaved, sensitive, with an incredibly noble nature.\u201d\nThe prosecutor was seeking to prove that there was premeditation ahead of the death. \u201cDo you remember if you threw him against the wall? \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cDo you remember if he stamped his feet?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cDid you have blood on your hands?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call an ambulance?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t call anyone!\u201d the accused shouted. She added that she was nervous, and completely frozen, something that she repeated several times.\n\u201cI started to smoke like crazy. I went out, came back in, went out, came back in. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. In that time I must have smoked four, five, six, seven, eight cigarettes,\u201d she continued. At that moment, she added, \u201cI saw a shovel and I decided to dig a hole. [...] I left the child and I went out to dig a small grave with a shovel that was in the garden. We were going to use that shovel to sort out the garden, just like the ax and the other tools.\u201d\nQuezada is facing Spain\u2019s maximum penalty, permanent reviewable prison\nBoth the shovel and the ax were shown to the jury, as was the pink towel that Quezada used to partially cover the body of the child after digging him up days later.\nThe defendant explained how she dragged the body outside and stuck it \u201cin the hole.\u201d She returned to the room for the ax because \u201cone of Gabriel\u2019s hands was left outside.\u201d She tried to chop his hand off with the ax, but said that she could not continue. (The autopsy revealed that she had broken the bones in his arm near his wrist.) \u201cSo I covered him up with earth,\u201d she told the court.\nThe jury was also told about the events of March 11, when Quezada \u2013 who by this point was under surveillance by the Civil Guard \u2013 dug up the child and took advantage of the fact that his father was with his ex-partner. \u201cI arrived at the property. I threw four stones at my dog, I uncovered Gabriel. I tried to touch him but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nThe jury was then shown the photos taken by the Civil Guard, of Quezada coming back and forth to the trunk of her car, with the body of the child.\nThe prosecutor also asked her about searches she had carried out on her computer. \u201cDid you search for a video about the 10 most poisonous plants?\u201d The defendant replied saying that she had a relative in Dominican Republic who is a beautician, and prepares face masks with those ingredients.\nThe mother of victim Gabriel Cruz, Patricia Ram\u00edrez, gave testimony in court on Tuesday afternoon behind closed doors. Unlike other relatives of the eight-year-old boy, she chose not to be separated from the defendant, Ana Julia Quezada, by a screen, legal sources reported.\nRam\u00edrez gave testimony to the court for 30 minutes, as did the father of the child, \u00c1ngel Cruz, who did request for a screen to be placed between himself and the self-confessed killer Quezada, who was his partner at the time of the youngster\u2019s death in February 2018.\nThe lawyer representing the child\u2019s parents, Francisco Torres, told reporters that the day had been \u201cvery hard\u201d for the parents, but had not provided \u201canything new.\u201d\nTorres explained that the parents, along with two other relatives of Gabriel, had confirmed the statements that they had made during the investigative phase of the case, and rejected the suggestion that the questions they were asked were \u201caimed at supporting\u201d the charges of psychological damage to the parents that Quezada is facing.\nDespite Quezada\u2019s refusal to answer questions from the lawyer for the private prosecution, Francisco Torres, he wanted his line of questioning to be recorded on the official record for the trial. He asked how Quezada could explain the massive bleeding in the child\u2019s brain that was found in the autopsy, whether Gabriel had helped her take the shovel and the ax out of the car, and whether she had previously tried to poison the child, \u201cgiven that he had two episodes of gastroenteritis\u201d after having been with her on Tuesdays, and if, when she removed his clothes, she was considering dismembering the body.\nThe defense lawyer, Esteban Hern\u00e1ndez, asked Quezada some of the same questions. She replied that the shovel and the ax were already at the property, and at no time had she tried to poison Gabriel.\nThe court session on Tuesday also heard testimony from 10 more people. Among them, four direct relatives of Gabriel\u2019s: his parents, \u00c1ngel Cruz and Patricia Ram\u00edrez, his cousin Mabel, and Carmen Sicilia, the grandmother of the eight-year-old. They did so in the afternoon behind closed doors, with no journalists present and no television feed. On their request, they were also separated from the defendant by a screen.\nQuezada arrived at the Almer\u00eda provincial courthouse a little before 9am on Tuesday. She is facing Spain\u2019s maximum penalty, permanent reviewable prison \u2013 the equivalent of life with a possibility of parole after a fixed term \u2013 if the jury finds her guilty of murder. Her defense is pleading reckless homicide, claiming that the child attacked Quezada with a hatchet and that she acted in self-defense. The jury, made up of seven women and two men, will have to decide her fate.\nDozens of witnesses and experts have been summoned to the provincial court of Almer\u00eda, where the trial is scheduled to end on September 19 after nine sessions.\nGabriel did not feel comfortable with the presence of his self-confessed killer, Ana Julia Quezada, in his family life. He had \u201cfeelings of anxiety\u201d and \u201cunspecified fear\u201d when faced with the defendant, according to the testimony of Francisco Mart\u00edn, a clinical psychologist who began treating the child\u2019s mother from mid-2017, around eight months before Quezada would take his life. Asked by the defense lawyer, Francisco Torres, as to whether this situation would be compatible with that of other children of divorced parents, Mart\u00edn replied: \u201cIt is possible.\u201d\nThe psychologist had been told about the situation of Gabriel by Ram\u00edrez herself, and he explained to the court that the youngster had a feeling of abandonment and lack of attention on the part of his father, but did not dare to tell him about it. The expert at the time encouraged the mother to take her son to a child psychologist, who would later suggest to the father \u2013 just a week before Gabriel disappeared \u2013 that he should \u201cintervene in the issue, take the situation seriously and increase the quality and amount of interaction that they had alone.\u201d\nMart\u00edn, who accompanied the family during the search for the boy, focused on two episodes that happened several weeks before Gabriel disappeared. During both of them, the child suffered symptoms of severe gastroenteritis, the cause of which was unclear for his doctor. These episodes, Mart\u00edn explained, \u201ccoincided with a Tuesday.\u201d That day, as well as Thursday, was when Gabriel would spend the afternoon alone at home with Quezada. Defense lawyer Francisco Torres asked Quezada in court on Tuesday: \u201cDid you try at any time to poison him?\u201d \u201cOf course not,\u201d she replied.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/11/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
