Spaniards went to the polls on November 10, giving an inconclusive victory to the incumbent Socialist Party (PSOE).\nThese four countries have not sufficiently used favorable economic times to put their public finances in order\nEC Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis\nThe Commission is warning Spain about the \u201crisk of significant non-compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact\u201d after Madrid sent in a draft budgetary plan for 2020 that is not updated with additional measures.\nPierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner for economic and financial affairs, called on Spain to pass a budget and introduce the kind of reforms required to address long-standing issues such as the structural deficit and high debt levels.\nHis statements were part of an annual assessment of national budgets in the euro zone known as the Autumn Fiscal Package. Moscovici noted that \u201cSpain, Portugal and Belgium presented budgetary plans based on unchanged policies; their new governments must present updated budget projects as soon as possible.\u201d Other countries at risk of non-compliance are France, Italy, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.\nCommission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis was particularly harsh in his assessment of Belgium, France, Spain and Italy, all of whom have high debt levels but few plans to bring them down.\n\u201cBelgium, Spain and France have very high debt-to-GDP ratios, of almost 100%. Italy\u2019s exceeds 136% of GDP. And these countries are not expected to meet the debt rule,\u201d said Dombrovskis.\n\u201cThese four countries have not sufficiently used favorable economic times to put their public finances in order. In 2020, they plan either no meaningful fiscal adjustment or even a fiscal expansion,\u201d he added, explaining that this is a matter for concern because very high debt levels limit the capacity to respond to economic shocks and market pressures.\nThe Commission believes that increased public spending is the main barrier to debt reduction\nThe EU has also asked Spain to reduce its structural deficit \u2013 the one that does not depend on cyclical economic changes \u2013 and to use any unexpected earnings from increased tax collection or interest rate savings to reduce the pile of debt.\nThe Commission believes that increased public spending is the main barrier to debt reduction, but its economic chiefs would not comment on the possibility of an expansive budget in Spain if the preliminary deal between the Socialists and the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos for a governing coalition becomes a reality. But they insisted that Madrid\u2019s draft budget plan must comply with the rules.\nBrussels believes that Spain\u2019s structural balance will deteriorate, and wants its budget to include \u20ac9.6 billion in adjustments to cover this gap. \u201cBelgium and Spain, which submitted budgetary plans based on a no-policy-change scenario, have been invited to submit updated plans in compliance with the SGP,\u201d said Dombrovskis.\nThese views are aligned with those of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which said in a November 2018 report that growth in Spain has been driven mostly by \u201cstrong private consumption and investment demand,\u201d while the country has failed to introduce structural reforms to offset any future downturn.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/21/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
