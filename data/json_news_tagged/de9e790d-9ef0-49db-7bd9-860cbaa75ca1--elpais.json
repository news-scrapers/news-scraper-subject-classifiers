A young man from Spain on Tuesday involuntarily triggered a security alert at Munich airport after walking through the wrong door on his way to catch a Madrid flight, said federal police in Germany.\nAs a result 130 flights were cancelled, causing numerous delays at one of the country\u2019s busiest airports, which was partially shut down for four hours. The Spaniard could face criminal proceedings over the incident.\nThe man said he was \u201chorrified\u201d at the outcome of his mistake\nThe man, who is reported to be aged between 20 and 25 years old, was on his way home after spending his vacation in Thailand and has stated that he was \u201chorrified\u201d at the outcome of his mistake during a stopover in Munich.\nThe Spaniard was arrested and interrogated by German security forces soon after the incident, which took place on Tuesday morning. He said that he had gone to the bathroom after stepping off a flight from Bangkok, and by the time he left the men\u2019s room all the other passengers had gone. Disoriented, he began walking in the wrong direction as he tried to find his connecting flight to Madrid.\nHe eventually pressed a button opening emergency doors to the restricted area reserved for passengers who have gone through a security check, according to the Bavarian public station BR24 and the local newspaper Merkur. This immediately triggered an alert, as it meant that a passenger from outside the border-free Schengen Area had bypassed passport controls. Parts of Terminal 1 and 2 were evacuated, and passengers who had already gone through security checks had to repeat the process.\nThere were around 1,200 departures scheduled at Munich airport on Tuesday, representing a flow of around 120,000 passengers.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/28/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
