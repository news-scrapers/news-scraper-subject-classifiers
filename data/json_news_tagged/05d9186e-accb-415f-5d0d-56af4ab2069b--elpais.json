It also expresses sympathy for all the people who were injured, and wishes them a speedy recovery.\u201d\nThis is irresponsible\nCatalan premier Quim Torra\nPressed by reporters to explain what he meant by violence, Torra said: \u201cI condemn all forms of violence,\u201d and stated that he wanted accountability for possible police excesses during clashes with protesters last week.\nTorra said that he had placed a new telephone call to Spain\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez of the Socialist Party (PSOE), but that the latter had again refused to speak to him. S\u00e1nchez was in Barcelona on Monday morning, but only met with police chiefs and officers who were injured in the street clashes.\n\u201cThis is irresponsible,\u201d said Torra, who wants \u201ca commitment for a political and democratic solution for Catalonia\u201d and \u201ca dialogue without any conditions,\u201d which could include the possibility of a legal referendum on breaking away from Spain. Last week, Torra suggested inside parliament that a new vote should be held before the end of this political term.\nDisagreement over the right to a referendum led to a breakdown in talks between the S\u00e1nchez administration and the Catalan government following the no-confidence vote that removed former PM Mariano Rajoy from power in late May 2018.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/22/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
