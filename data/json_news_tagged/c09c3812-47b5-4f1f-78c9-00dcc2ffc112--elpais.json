The 20,000 attendees of the event in New Jersey were silent as a flamenco voice sang out. Rosal\u00eda, dressed all in black, lit up the Prudential Center. Last night the 25-year-old, who is from Catalonia, became the first female Spanish artist to have received a prize at the event. In 2001, Spain\u2019s Alejandro Sanz took the MTV Latin America International Viewer\u2019s Choice award for for the video for his song El Alma al Aire.\nRosal\u00eda came up onto the stage, accompanied by J Balvin, to receive an award for the Best Latin Video for the song Con Altura. \u201cI come from Barcelona,\u201d she said after collecting the prize. \u201cThank you for inviting me to sing on this stage in Spanish.\u201d\nTaylor Swift was in charge of opening the night, and taking the audience on a voyage that MTV wanted to be a magical one. And in part, it was. The pop superstar sang You Need to Calm Down on a stage that looked like the stomach of a unicorn, while Rosal\u00eda and Camila Cabello danced along. The magic continued to flow when hip-hop legend Missy Elliot sang through a compilation of her hits as rain fell from the ceiling, volcanoes spit out lava and a spaceship landed on the stage.\nEarlier this week, Rosal\u00eda was also in the headlines after former US President Barack Obama published on Twitter a list of songs that he and his wife Michelle had been listening to over the summer. Among them, at number 31, was Con Altura, the same song that won Rosal\u00eda and J Balvin their prize at last night\u2019s MTV awards. It was not the first time that the Obamas had put a Spanish artist on their summer playlists. In 2015, they included Tengo un trato by La Mala Rodr\u00edguez.\nIn May of this year, Con Altura was named one of the 10 best songs of the year so far by the prestigious US magazine Time. While the reggaeton-influenced collaboration was not to all of her fans\u2019 tastes, the song won the admiration of the publication, praising her for proving herself \u201cchameleonic during her swift ascent over the last year,\u201d having handled \u201cJames Blake ballads, voluptuous dancehall anthems and mournful Justin Timberlake interpolations with equal aplomb.\u201d As for the song, Time said it sounded like \u201cdembow, hip-hop and flamenco, with middle eastern influences sprinkled in,\u201d concluding that it \u201csounds like the future of global pop music.\u201d\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Rosal\u00eda was the first Spanish artist to win an MTV Video Music Award when in fact Alejandro Sanz received one in 2001.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/27/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
