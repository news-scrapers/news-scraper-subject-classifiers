An emergency team located the remains \u2013 which are still pending forensic testing \u2013 of Commander Francisco Mar\u00edn N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who was the only crew member on board.\nAt around 9.38am, emergency services were flooded with hundreds of calls from La Manga, reporting that a plane had fallen into the sea.

Vessels from the Monitoring and Rescue Plan (COPLA), maritime rescue, Red Cross and the Civil Guard also took part in the rescue effort.\nThe mayor of San Javier, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Luengo, confirmed that the crash took place near Zoco in La Manga.\nOn Twitter, two users shared videos of the moment of the accident, filmed from Gal\u00faa beach. In the video, the plane is seen to nosedive then try to straighten up. But when the plane is almost parallel to the sea, it hits the water. In the video, a dot is seen behind the tail of aircraft, which could be the pilot after ejecting. Parts of the crashed plane washed up on the shores of the beach, where there was a strong smell of gasoline.\nThe C-101 model, manufactured by the Spanish company CASA, is known in the military as an E-25 Mirlo and is used for advanced basic training at the Air Force. Mar\u00edn N\u00fa\u00f1ez belonged to the Air Force Academy. According to Civil Protection, it is not yet known why the plane crashed.\nThe accident comes after seven people were killed on Sunday in a midair collision between a light plane and a helicopter in Mallorca, in Spain\u2019s Balearic Islands. A German family with two children and the Italian pilot of the helicopter, as well as the two Spaniards on board the plane, died in the accident.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/26/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
