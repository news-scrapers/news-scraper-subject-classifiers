L.. Not because the business \u2013 which is based in Cuenca, in the central Castile-La Mancha region \u2013 has a lot of gravestones to make, but because it will help raise the tombstone of a grave belonging to a very particular person: Francisco Franco.\nFor agreeing to do this job, the owners of the company have been inundated with angry phone calls and threats from the far right. Indeed, the ongoing threats have forced the owners to report the incidents to the Civil Guard, as confirmed by one of the brothers. These days the brothers Juan Carlos and Lorenzo Verdugo are the subject of conversation in bars in Villamayor de Santiago, a town in Cuenca that is home to 2,500 people. Up until just a few days go, the brothers were working in their workshop without being hassled by the media, in the same discreet and calm way they have been working since they inherited the business from their father a decade ago.\nI am not doing this for fame so that my name appears everywhere, I am doing this so that my daughters have everything they need\nCompany owner Lorenzo Verdugo\nThe company\u2019s main business is in making gravestones and marble finishings, especially for indoor spaces. But while the exhumation of Fanco from the Valley of the Fallen has caused great national commotion, the Verdugo brothers did not expect their names to end up in the media, say people close to them. \u201cThey basically thought that this was going to stay in the town,\u201d explain the sources.\nLocals in the town say that the news has been an open secret for weeks, long before one of the company\u2019s vans was photographed at the entrance to the Valley of the Fallen. The truck was bringing different tools and machines that will be needed to move and raise the dictator\u2019s granite tombstone, which weighs nearly 2,000 kilos, according to sources close to the business. The logo of the business, which appears on the side of the van, confirmed the town\u2019s suspicions. The contact details of their workshop \u2013 easily found with a simple Google search \u2013 were then shared on social media, often by users who showed support for Spain\u2019s fascist-inspired party Falange on their accounts. Many even left company reviews with messages such as: \u201cGrave vandals.\u201d\nThe relentless hostile calls forced the owners to take their phone off the hook. In a matter of hours, their peaceful existence had come to an end. \u201cWe are fed up with this situation,\u201d says Lorenzo Verdugo in a faltering voice. He confirms that they have received threats and reported the abuse to the Civil Guard.\nIt is a profanation. But I don\u2019t judge these guys, it\u2019s their job\nLocal from Villamayor de Santiago\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to spot the humble workshop of the Verdugo brothers from the other buildings on the street where it is located. Two steel-sheet doors and a small sign identify it from the rest of the one-story homes. The door is opened by a man who prefers not to say his name, but says he is the brothers\u2019 uncle. \u201cThey are very worried, it will be difficult to find them here,\u201d he says in a low voice. Residents of the town say the same thing: \u201cThey have been seen less here recently.\u201d\nIn one of the bars in the town, two elderly people discuss the Verdugos. \u201cEveryone knows the brothers. They inherited the workshop and have done a magnificent job [...] They are good guys but you have to let the dead rest,\u201d says one of them, in reference to Franco. \u201cIt is a profanation. But I\u2019m not judging these guys, it\u2019s their job,\u201d adds another local from the town.\nLorenzo Verdugo is eager for the exhumation to be over and the remains of Franco reburied in the El Pardo-Mingorrubio cemetery. He and his brother have been caught in the crossfire of something that, they admit, is nothing more to them than a job. \u201cI am not doing this for fame so that my name appears everywhere, I am doing this so that my daughters have everything they need. The rest doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d says Verdugo.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/23/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
