The director of UC Global S. L. is being investigated by Spain\u2019s High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, after allegedly ordering the private conversations of the WikiLeaks founder to be spied on, as well as supposedly passing the information collected to the United States\u2019 intelligence services.\nTwo firearms with their serial numbers erased were found in Morales\u2019 home, as well as \u20ac20,000 in cash\nMorales\u2019 arrest took place on September 17 in the southern Spanish city of Jerez de la Frontera, which is where the security firm is based. The information had not come to light until now given that the investigation is under seal.\nPolice officers searched the company\u2019s offices and also seized hard disks and documents, all of which are now being analyzed by the judge in charge of the case, Jos\u00e9 de la Mata. According to judicial sources, two firearms with their serial numbers erased were found in Morales\u2019 home, as well as \u20ac20,000 in cash. Morales was taken to Madrid were he was questioned at the High Court before being released on bail. His passport was taken from him and his bank accounts frozen. He currently has to check in at the High Court every two weeks.\nInvestigations into Morales and his security company began in August, after EL PA\u00cdS revealed the existence of confidential reports put together by UC Global S. L.\nInvestigations into Morales and his security company began in August, several weeks after EL PA\u00cdS revealed the existence of videos, audio recordings and confidential reports put together by UC Global S. L., which reveal that meetings held by Assange with his lawyers and colleagues were spied on. The tapes are potential evidence of a violation of client-attorney confidentiality.\nThe United States has requested that Assange be extradited from the United Kingdom to face charges related to WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of information related to secret military action in Afghanistan and Iraq. He is accused of offenses that potentially carry with them 175 years in jail.\nAfter the revelations were published by EL PA\u00cdS, Assange\u2019s defense team filed a criminal complaint against Morales, in which he is accused of alleged privacy offenses as well as the violation of attorney-client privilege, misappropriation of funds, bribery and money laundering. Neither Morales nor his lawyer have responded to requests from EL PA\u00cdS to provide their version of events.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/09/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
