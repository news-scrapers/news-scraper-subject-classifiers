What\u2019s more he has offered the leader of the left-wing anti-austerity party, Pablo Iglesias, \u201ca rigorous system of control\u201d to ensure that a potential government headed by his Socialist Party (PSOE) sticks to any governing deal.\nSpain has been in political limbo since the April 28 elections, at which the PSOE won most votes but fell short of an absolute majority. Negotiations were put on hold until the results of the May 26 regional, local and European elections came in. But despite months of subsequent talks, S\u00e1nchez was unable to secure the essential support of Iglesias ahead of a first round of investiture votes in July, given the insistence of the latter politician on the creation of a coalition government, something that the PSOE refused given their differences on policy.\nPedro S\u00e1nchez described his offer as a \u201ctriple guarantee\u201d for Unidas Podemos\nS\u00e1nchez also today offered Unidas Podemos \u2013 which itself is a coalition of the party founded by Iglesias and the United Left (IU) \u2013 \u201ckey responsibilities\u201d in state institutions that are not subordinated to the Cabinet. He also called on the parties\u2019 negotiating teams to meet on September 5. Another meeting between S\u00e1nchez and Iglesias has yet to be confirmed, but it could take place sometime next week.\nS\u00e1nchez described the offer as a \u201ctriple guarantee\u201d for Podemos, given that it includes an office connected to the Finance Ministry that would ensure that any governing deal is respected; monitoring committees in both Congress and the Senate; and a third guarantee mechanism in which members of civil society would participate. \u201cWe don\u2019t want votes at our investiture for free,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said of what he described in an interview with EL PA\u00cdS published this past weekend as a \u201cthird way\u201d forward, somewhere between the coalition government that Podemos has been demanding, and the PSOE minority government that the acting prime minister is pushing for.\n\u201cIf the problem with Unidas Podemos is mistrust, let\u2019s build trust and establish maximum guarantees,\u201d S\u00e1nchez told a crowd of 700 people today at a presentation of the 370 measures. \u201cOur attitude is sincere, we must not become enemies. We can be loyal allies as we have been in the past.\u201d\nHours before S\u00e1nchez took to the stage, during an interview on state broadcaster TVE, Iglesias repeated his demand for Unidas Podemos to be given ministries in exchange for support for the PSOE. But the acting PM today repeated his view that this would be \u201cunworkable\u201d and \u201cunfeasible\u201d after the failure of the investiture vote in July, before which Iglesias had been offered one of the two deputy prime ministerial roles in the Cabinet, and three ministries.\nHours before S\u00e1nchez took to the stage, Iglesias repeated his demand for Unidas Podemos to be given ministries\n\u201cOn July 25 the deal became impossible,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat was then unworkable continues to be unworkable. We reached a never-before-seen scenario, one that no one in our country had reached before, but the proposal was rejected and our suspicions were confirmed that this would be two governments in one, a compartmentalized and divided government at a time of major challenges that could become risks,\u201d he said, in reference to the economic slowdown, a potential \u201chard Brexit,\u201d whereby the United Kingdom crashes out of the European Union on October 31 without a deal, and the crisis in Catalonia, where a sentence is expected this fall in the trial of the politicians at the center of the 2017 independence drive.\nThe policy points announced today by the PSOE include the reversal of labor reforms implemented by the conservative PP, constitutional protection for pension rises, and tax hikes for higher earners and large companies in order to pay for a wide range of social measures.\nSome of the other plans include measures to combat \u201cabusive\u201d rent rises, a roll-out of a free daycare system across the country, \u201clow-emission zones\u201d similar to the Madrid Central scheme in cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants, and a tightening of sexual assault laws to ensure that if a women \u201cdoes not specifically say yes, everything else is a no.\u201d\nSpeaking on TVE this morning, Iglesias said he would take his time to study the proposal. \u201cSome of the measures sound good,\u201d he said on Tuesday, but would not be drawn on a more complete response until his party got the chance to study the whole document.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/03/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
