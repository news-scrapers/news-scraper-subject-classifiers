A long time had passed since she had last requested the woman\u2019s services, and she gave her precise instructions on what she had to do. She told her to bring her car and park it in her building.\nWhen the domestic employee arrived at the property, which is a small duplex with a lounge and a kitchen on the ground floor, and two bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs, she found several \u201cbig, black and heavy\u201d trash bags by the front door. According to the statement that the cleaning lady made to the Civil Guard, after she cleaned the entire house, Merino asked her to take the bags to her car and to dispose of them wherever she could. The cleaner, who does not remember seeing the partner of Carmen, Jes\u00fas Mari Baranda, 67, that day, did exactly what her boss had told her.\nThe authorities believe that those trash bags could have contained the body of Baranda, after the man\u2019s severed head was found in a box that Merino had given to a neighbor for safekeeping. The horrifying discovery was made a week ago and has prompted all kinds of speculation. The police are now looking for the rest of the man\u2019s remains in the Meruelo trash dump, one of the biggest in Cantabria. They are not, however, hopeful of finding the body. Merino is being held in custody on suspicion of murder.\nThe police are looking for the rest of the man\u2019s remains in the Meruelo trash dump, one of the biggest in Cantabria\nIt was in the early hours of Saturday, September 28 when Carmen\u2019s friend, a woman from Utrera, Seville, decided to investigate exactly what was inside the box that Carmen had given her in March. Her friend had told her that it contained \u201csex toys,\u201d and that she wanted it out of her property ahead of a possible search by the Civil Guard related to the disappearance of Baranda, which was reported by one of his cousins. The box, however, had started to give off a terrible smell, which is what prompted the neighbor to open it up.\nTests have confirmed that the severed head belonged to Baranda, and according to sources close to the investigation, had signs of having been manipulated \u2013 \u201cpossibly burned.\u201d Tests are ongoing in the Cantabrian capital of Santander in order to try to determine the date and cause of the man\u2019s death.\nIt was not until March of this year that one of the victim\u2019s cousins reported the disappearance of Baranda, who used to work for a bank in Bilbao and was divorced with two children, with whom he had lost contact. \u201cCarmen told us that he had gone on a trip,\u201d the relative explained last week. According to his version of events, Merino told Baranda\u2019s family that he had changed his cellphone, and gave them a new number. His relatives received messages from that new number, but as time passed and given the tone of the messages \u2013 \u201cHe didn\u2019t speak like that,\u201d the cousin explained \u2013 their suspicions were raised. Despite their requests, the person on the other end of the cellphone refused to send a voice message or make a video call.\nDespite the circumstances, however, the relatives never suspected that Merino could be involved in her partner\u2019s disappearance. \u201cThey were a seemingly happy couple,\u201d his relatives reported, according to sources from the investigation. \u201cHe treated her like a queen.\u201d Their unexpected police report \u2013 \u201cCarmen was annoyed that we went to the police without telling her,\u201d the cousin stated \u2013 alarmed Merino, prompting her to get rid of the head that she still had in her possession.\nTests have confirmed that the severed head belonged to Baranda, and had signs of having been manipulated \u2013 \u201cpossibly burned\u201d\n\u201cI found it stuck in a box on the mat outside the front door and I kept it because it was the only thing I had of his,\u201d Merino reportedly told investigators about her partner\u2019s head when the case broke. When asked about what happened to his cellphone, she said that \u201cit had fallen in the bath.\u201d\nThe motive of the crime continues to be an unknown, although investigators suspect that it is related to money. Merino did not work and had no income, and was completely dependent on her partner. According to police sources, the suspect \u201chas no criminal record,\u201d but did have problems with money in the past, albeit without having been reported to the police. During the time that Baranda was missing, his pension was still being paid into his bank account, to which Merino had access. Now that his death has come to light, however, that source of income will have disappeared.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/07/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
