This confirms that its processing plant is one of the infected sites behind the current outbreak of listeriosis that has so far affected 200 people throughout Spain, most of them in Andalusia. A 90-year-old woman died in the early hours of Monday in a Seville hospital after having contracted the bacterial infection, while it emerged on Friday that a terminal cancer patient had died with listeria in their bloodstream. It is not yet clear, however, whether that patient\u2019s death was related to the outbreak.\nIf the larding needles were contaminated, there is no doubt that other areas of the production line were too\nProfessor Juan Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez\nCarne mechada, the product produced by Magrudis that is thought to be behind the outbreak, the biggest ever seen in Spain, is made by cooking pork loin in its own fat. The lard is introduced into the meat using larding needles before it is cooked. It is then usually served cold and in thin slices. The company sells the carne mechada, along with other similar products \u2013 such as lomo, preserved pork loin, and chicharrones, pork belly \u2013 under the brand name La Mech\u00e1. Seville City Hall confirmed on Friday that two other La Mech\u00e1 products have been found to be contaminated: pork loin with sherry, and pork loin with paprika.\nSpain issued an international alert on Thursday with European authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) \u201cgiven the possibility that cases might be detected in other countries,\u201d should tourists visiting the country have consumed the affected products. So far no cases have been detected outside Spanish territory.\nIt also emerged on Friday that the carne mechada produced by Magrudis had been sold on to a firm called Comercial Mart\u00ednez Le\u00f3n for resale with a different brand name. The authorities were not aware of this fact until August 20, five days after the initial health alert was raised. These products were in circulation until they were ordered to be withdrawn on August 21.\nSamples were taken from the company\u2019s production plant last Friday, and the results were returned on Monday. The analysis of the larding needles was the first to become public knowledge.\nListeriosis is a bacterial infection that can cause sepsis, meningitis and encephalitis, and can even be fatal\n\u201cIf the larding needles were contaminated, there is no doubt that other areas of the production line were too,\u201d said Juan Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, a professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and a member of the Spanish Society of Food Safety. Rodr\u00edguez explained that the \u201clarding needle is an instrument used to fill raw meat, meaning that the bacteria should not survive the roasting process, and the final contamination may have taken place during another moment on the production line.\u201d He added that the results were \u201cworrying, because they reveal widespread contamination that was unknown to the heads of the company.\u201d\nThis new information points to a twofold failure in the Magrudis production line, according to experts consulted by EL PA\u00cdS. The first, which has now been confirmed, implies a lack of hygiene in the processing plant itself. The second is the failure to detect the contamination of the final meat products, despite existing legislation obliging such producers to carry out tests on at least five samples of every batch produced.\nThese rules mean that food-production companies must design and execute a plan to guarantee that their products are put on the market with no risks to human health. Each firm has the freedom to carry out such plans however they see fit, but they are subject to regular inspections from the health authorities.\nThe current outbreak of listeriosis has so far affected 200 people throughout Spain, most of them in Andalusia\nAs well as carne mechada, Magrudis also produces eight more products at its plant. The regional government in Andalusia, known as the Junta, requested that Seville City Hall carry out tests on these products on August 19 and ordered them to be taken off the market on August 21, a move that sources from the Junta said were precautionary. The central Health Ministry in Madrid advised on Thursday that consumers should not eat any of the products made by the Seville-based firm.\nThe tests carried out on the plant prompted tensions on Thursday between the Andalusian government \u2013 headed up by the conservative Popular Party (PP) and center-right Citizens, with the support of far-right Vox \u2013 and the acting health minister, Mar\u00eda Luisa Carcedo of the Socialist Party (PSOE). The spokesperson from the Junta\u2019s committee in charge of managing the listeriosis crisis, Doctor Jos\u00e9 Miguel Cisneros, expressed his discomfort yesterday over statements made by Carcedo in which she confirmed that the outbreak had originated in the Seville company. \u201cThe Health Ministry is not intervening here because these powers are transferred to the autonomous regions,\u201d Cisneros stated.\nOn Friday, it was reported that 82% of new cases in Andalusia were registered in Seville. In total, there were 99 people receiving hospital treatment, 17 more than on Thursday. Of these, 31 are pregnant women. Four people are currently being treated in intensive care, one more than the previous day. Of those in hospital, 18 have been confirmed to have listeriosis, while the remainder of patients are still being tested.\nListeriosis is a bacterial infection that can cause severe illnesses such as sepsis, meningitis and encephalitis, and can even be fatal. Those most at risk are pregnant women, the elderly, unborn babies and newborns, or people whose immune systems are compromised. The infection can also cause gastroenteritis and fever. It is primarily transmitted, as in this current outbreak in Spain, by the ingestion of contaminated foods.\nEVA SA\u00cdZ / CRISTIAN L\u00d3PEZ\nSeville\nSocial alarm over the listeriosis outbreak has seen emergency rooms in Seville overwhelmed by an increase in potential patients. On Wednesday night, medical staff from the Virgen del Roc\u00edo hospital, one of the biggest in the Andalusian capital, dealt with 100 more people than usual, 23% above the average. The majority had symptoms of the bacterial infection, according to a spokesperson from the Junta committee managing the crisis. The pressure on medical teams is such that doctors are resorting to WhatsApp groups to request help to cover shifts and draft in reinforcements, according to messages to which EL PA\u00cdS has had access.\nDespite extra staff being drafted in, the wait times in the emergency room at Virgen del Roc\u00edo on Thursday evening were as high as four hours, and the personnel at the hospital were overwhelmed. Zahara Palos, a 28-year-old woman, arrived at 3pm with symptoms of diarrhea and fever. She was not seen by doctors until 7pm. \u201cI\u2019m desperate,\u201d she complained. \u201cI want to leave here with a solution.\u201d\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/23/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
