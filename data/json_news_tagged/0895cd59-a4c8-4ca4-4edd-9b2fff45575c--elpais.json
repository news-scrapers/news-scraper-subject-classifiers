In fact, surveys from the European Union\u2019s statistical office, Eurostat, and a report from the foreign language company, Education First, place Spain close to the bottom of the ladder compared to the rest of Europe when it comes to English proficiency.\nSocio-economic status influences language skills, and Spain is still a relatively poor country in Europe\nAntonio Cabrales, professor at University College London\nAccording to experts, the poor result is explained in part by the size of Spain, its relatively low GDP per capita and the number of people who speak Spanish worldwide.\nUnlike other countries, the number of Spaniards who can speak English has scarcely changed in the last 10 years. And Spaniards in the 25-34 age bracket level have been left far behind their peers in Greece, Portugal and Italy, which had similarly low rates of English speakers 10 years ago.\nThe 2019 English Proficiency Index places Spain in 25th place out of a total of 33 European countries and 35th in the world, with no improvement noted since last year. The international ranking,\u00a0drawn up by Education First, a company founded in Sweden in 1965 which publishes the index annually, was based on the results of 2.3 million exams in 100 countries.\nEurostat meanwhile showed that in 2007, 46.6% of Spaniards between the ages of 25 and 64 could not speak a foreign language. In 2016 \u2013 the most recent data available \u2013 this figure had dropped only marginally to 45.8%. During the same period, Portugal reduced this figure from 51% to 31%, Greece from 43% to 33%, and Italy from 38% to 34%. In all three of these countries, more than 82% of people between the ages of 25 and 34 were able to speak at least one foreign language \u2013 in Spain that figure was only 66%. Eurostat also found that English is the most studied foreign language in the EU with 94% of students still taking it in the second cycle of secondary school.\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland have worse foreign language skills than Spain\n\u201cThe statistics are bad,\u201d says Antonio Cabrales, a professor at University College London who has researched how English is learned in bilingual schools in Spain. \u201cOne of the reasons for this is to do with wealth. Like any other subject, socio-economic status influences language skills, and Spain is still a relatively poor country in Europe. Another factor is the size of the country. If you compare countries with a similar income bracket, normally the big ones perform worse. The small ones are generally more open to the outside world and their citizens see more opportunities both professionally and otherwise in learning foreign languages. Large countries have a larger domestic market and are not as concerned [about learning a language].\u201d\nFrance, for example, does worse in language surveys and exams than Belgium; while Austria performs better than Germany. According to the data from Eurostat and the Education First, the countries with the best level of English (where English is not the official language) are Nordic countries, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.\n\u201cIn a number of countries where there has been a big improvement in the last decade, the younger generation have been making an effort,\u201d says Cabrales. \u201cIn the case of Spain, young people are not very good [at languages]. Given the weight that tourism carries in our economy, it is really hard to understand.\u201d\nAnother issue is the fact that Spanish is the fourth most-spoken language in the world, with 580 million people speaking it with varying degrees of fluency, according to a report by the Cervantes Institute published in October. Consequently, there is a long tradition of translation and dubbing in the publishing and audiovisual industries. \u201cThis is something that doesn\u2019t happen in other countries,\u201d says Cabrales. \u201cPeople are forced to watch more films and TV shows in the original language.\u201d\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland are among the seven EU countries on Eurostat\u2019s list of 28 that have worse foreign language skill than Spain. The other five are Bulgaria, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Hungary, and Romania.\nEnglish learning in Spain has undergone a transformation in the last 20 years\nMaureen McAlinden, British Council in Spain\nBut Maureen McAlinden, who runs British Council initiatives in Spain, believes there have been changes at least in the level of English proficiency. According to Eurostat, when the level of proficiency in a foreign language is taken into account, Spain sits somewhere in the middle compared to other European countries. This suggests that those who need to speak good English are able to, even if it means paying out for private classes to compensate for an education system that can\u2019t guarantee results.\n\u201cEnglish learning in Spain has undergone a transformation in the last 20 years and the level has improved a lot,\u201d says McAlinden who arrived in Spain in 1996. \u201cIt is something I have noticed personally and we are also seeing it in our centers. There aren\u2019t so many courses for beginners, for A-1, A-2 or B-1. Now there is more demand for B-2 and C-1, and there are also those seeking a certificate for the level they already have. What\u2019s more, more than 12,000 Spanish students study degrees and post-graduate courses in the UK, not to mention those who study in English in other countries or do courses [taught in English] at Spanish universities.\u201d\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/11/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
