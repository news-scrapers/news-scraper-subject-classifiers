It is also uncertainty regarding the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, a process commonly referred to as \u0090\u201cBrexit.\u201d The number of British nationals who are now officially registered in Spain \u2013 most of them in Andalusia and the Valencia region \u2013 has risen by a record 10% since December 2018.\nThe lack of clarity over Brexit is prompting many British citizens to register with the Spanish authorities \u2013 either at an Immigration Office or at a designated local police station \u2013 something they perhaps would never have done were it not for the potential imminent divorce of the UK from Europe on October 31. There are now 365,967 Britons officially registered in Spain. Figures provided by the Interior Ministry in response to questions from EL PA\u00cdS reveal that the numbers are rising at an accelerating rate, and it is likely that they will go up even more quickly immediately before and after the Brexit deadline.\nThe campaigns carried out by the British embassies abroad \u2013 particularly in Spain \u2013 are also responsible for the development. Although the data does not distinguish between new arrivals and Britons who were already residing unofficially in the country, sources consulted by EL PA\u00cdS believe that a good many fall into the latter category.\n\u201cWe are advising British nationals who have been in Spain longer than three months and want to remain here to legalize their [residency] status,\u201d says Sarah-Jane Morris, one of the three British consuls in Spain. \u201cAnd the data suggests they are taking this seriously.\u201d\nBesides those Britons who have been officially resident in Spain for years, there is also a floating population of UK nationals, some of whom only spend part of the year in the country. There are, of course, also those who reside in Spain on a permanent basis but have failed to make their residence official as they were already guaranteed enough rights thanks to their home country\u2019s membership of the EU.\nThere are now 365,967 Britons officially registered in Spain\n\u201cSome had probably not thought of doing it, but with Brexit it is important to get residency papers,\u201d says Morris, who is responsible for UK citizens in the center, north and southeast of Spain.\nThere are even more people flocking to register now than directly after the 2016 referendum, which saw 52% of the UK vote to leave the EU. During that period, the number of Brits registered rose by just 4.6%, according to data from Spain\u2019s Labor Ministry.\nThe data of the Brits registered in Spain show that the British community is concentrated along the coast, predominantly in Alicante and M\u00e1laga, and more than a third of residents are over 65. \u201cThe typical British national on the coast is probably in retirement,\u201d says Morris. \u201cWhile in cities such as Madrid and Barcelona they tend to be people who are working.\u201d\nThe benefits Britons in Spain will be able to receive after Brexit will depend on a bilateral agreement that the two countries\u2019 governments have already signed, and which is focused on maintaining the status quo even if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal.\nSpain has even drawn up a contingency plan to issue permits to residents who are left in limbo. To take advantage of the agreement, Brits in Spain must first register officially. The British Embassy has had 200 meetings with British residents since the 2016 referendum to encourage this idea.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/18/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
