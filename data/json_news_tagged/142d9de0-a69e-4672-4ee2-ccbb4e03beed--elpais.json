But Conte has come up against his own interior minister, Matteo Salvini of the right-wing League, who continues to refuse the ship entry.\nOn Thursday evening, nine more migrants were evacuated from the ship \u2013 five who are in ill health and four relatives. This leaves 138 still on board a vessel that was not built to hold so many people for such a prolonged period of time. Last week US actor Richard Gere showed up to deliver food and water after learning of their plight.\nThe European offer of help, which was revealed by Conte in an open letter on Facebook, comes after the European Commission contacted several countries informally in a bid to find a negotiated solution to the latest migrant crisis to affect the continent. The letter criticized Salvini for his hard-line position on immigration.\nSpain will be part of this group of six countries, as well as Portugal, France, Germany, Romania and Luxembourg. Government sources said that EU officials are in talks with more member states to see whether they are willing to take in some of the migrants.\n\u00a0Until now, the Spanish government had resisted taking in any of these migrants on the basis that Spain is already under migratory pressure from Morocco, a departure point for many people trying to reach Europe.\nBut the deteriorating conditions on board the ship, and the fact that it is operated by a Spanish non-profit group, Proactiva Open Arms, have weighed on the decision to take in some of the 147 individuals who remain on the ship. Around 16 have already been evacuated to Italy for medical reasons. The migrants were rescued at sea after attempting the dangerous crossing from Libya.\nThe executive of acting Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, of the Socialist Party (PSOE), has agreed to participate in a migrant distribution scheme that is being informally coordinated by the European Commission.\nAlthough the S\u00e1nchez administration originally adopted an open-port attitude, unilaterally taking in hundreds of rescued migrants who had been rejected by Italy, this policy has changed in the last year. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska has complained repeatedly in Brussels that migrants arriving through the central Mediterranean route cannot not be distributed across the EU while Spain is expected to unilaterally deal with all the arrivals through the western route.\nThe government\u2019s newest position has been influenced by worsening conditions aboard the Open Arms and by domestic pressure \u2013 there has been a deluge of offers of help by Spanish regional and municipal authorities, and petitions asking S\u00e1nchez for a solution.\nOne of the last times that Spain found itself in a similar situation was in December 2018, when a dozen migrants were rescued by a Spanish fishing vessel called Nuestra Madre Loreto. Spanish authorities first instructed the captain to take the migrants back to Libya, but the ship finally docked in Malta under a pledge that Spain would take them in.\nJust a few days after that, the Open Arms sailed into the Spanish port of Algeciras with 300 rescued migrants, and there was no distribution among EU countries. Since then, Madrid had refused to take charge of any more migrants rescued on the \u201cItalian\u201d route.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/15/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
