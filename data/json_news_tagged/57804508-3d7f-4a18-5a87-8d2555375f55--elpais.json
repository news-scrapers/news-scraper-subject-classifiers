The global environmental conference, known as COP25, was meant to be held in the Chilean capital of Santiago but anti-government protests, which have left dozens dead, hundreds of injuries and caused significant damage to the city, have forced the Chilean government to cancel.\nLess than 24 hours after the announcement was made public, Chile\u2019s President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era said on Thursday that Spain\u2019s caretaker Socialist Party (PSOE) government had offered to host COP25, which is set to take place between December 2 and 13. Around 25,000 people are expected to attend the event, including representatives from the governments, NGOs and businesses from scores of different countries. On Friday, the UN issued a brief statement confirming that Madrid would be the new host city for the event.\nSpain will have just over a month to organize the COP25, which is usually planned a year in advance\nHosting the COP25 will be an organizational challenge for Spain, given that there is only one month to plan the event, and these types of international conferences \u2013 which cost around $100 million (\u20ac90 million) \u2013 are usually planned a year in advance. The offer to hold COP25 in Madrid is similar to Spain\u2019s offer to host the soccer final of the Copa Libertadores in 2018.\nSpain has never hosted a climate summit before, but despite the short time frame, government sources are confident they will be able to organize the event by December. The event comes as Spain prepares for a general election on November 10.\nMadrid\u2019s hotel sector is confident it will be ready for the COP25 in December. \u201cWe are very eager to show what Madrile\u00f1os are capable of,\u201d said Gabriel Garc\u00eda Alonso, the president of Madrid\u2019s Hotel Association, after learning that the Spanish capital could be the new venue of the international summit. \u201cWe are a city that is completely prepared to host these events.\u201d\nAccording to Garc\u00eda Alonso, Madrid has already proved it is capable of managing an event of this scale: \u201cWhen we hosted the Copa de Libertadores, there was no conflict. And because of that, more events have taken place here, such as the Champions League [soccer final] in May.\u201d\nThe final of the Copa de Libertadores brought economic benefits of between \u20ac40 and \u20ac55 million to Madrid, according to estimates from Madrid City Hall and Madrid\u2019s Business Confederation (CEIM).\nThe president of CEIM, Miguel Garrido, is positive the COP25 will be equally economically beneficial. \u201cIt means a rise in direct income and also induced income because it is a major world showcase,\u201d he said. \u201cMadrid is perfectly prepared to host an initiative of these dimensions,\u201d he added.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/01/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
