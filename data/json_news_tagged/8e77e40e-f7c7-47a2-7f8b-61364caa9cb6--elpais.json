At age 29, a back injury left him a paraplegic, and when he was 33, he lost his sight after suffering from pneumonia. But none of this has dampened his zest for life. Together with his carer, Cristina \u00c1lvarez Castellanos, Sergio has invented a new sign language, which is available on an online platform to anyone who may find it useful.\n\u201cI am a positive person and I have a strong character. This illness has only made me stronger. You could say that it has opened my eyes. Now I can see more than before,\u201d the 37-year-old from Murcia tells EL PA\u00cdS. Sergio has a five-year-old daughter, and currently studies journalism and documentation science.\nThis illness has only made me stronger\nSergio Romero\nBefore meeting Cristina, a carer from the ONCE Foundation for the Care of Persons with Deafblindness (FOAPS), Sergio communicated by tracing capital letters on his forehead with his index finger. \u201cI wanted to use a faster system and then it occurred to us to adapt the Spanish sign language by transferring the signs to my face, shoulders and neck,\u201d where he has more feeling.\nBecause some of the signs couldn\u2019t be adapted, they started to make up their own. \u201cIt reminds me a bit of mime. For example, for the word \u2018to dance,\u2019 you put your two hands on the sides of your face and move them, like if my face was dancing. It's a mime based on touch,\u201d he explains.\nSergio and Cristina started to create the language \u2013 which they have called SERCRI (a combination of both their names) \u2013 in 2017. Since then, they have \u201cinvented words every day.\u201d They have around 500 words, according to Cristina, although Sergio insists it\u2019s closer to 1,000. This was the only time they disagreed during the interview. \u201cWe\u2019ll count them this afternoon,\u201d Cristina says.\nSergio makes it clear than he doesn\u2019t want to \u201cimpose\u201d his communication system on anyone, only offer it as an alternative language to those in a similar situation to him. There are around 7,000 deafblind people in Spain. It is a very diverse group, and they have very different ways of communicating. \u201cThey tend to be people who are very isolated, it's not a well-known disability and there are many differences and degrees to it,\u201d Cristina points out.\nSince 2017, Sergio and Cristina have \u201cinvented words every day\u201d\nSergio, who before becoming blind had studied software programming, has launched the platform Esquivando Barreras (or Overcoming Barriers) on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, which regularly shares videos on how to interpret SERCRI signs. In addition to offering an \u201calternative form of communication,\u201d Sergio and Cristina\u2019s objective is \u201cto help people in the same situation, to try to stop them getting depressed, to let them know that all is not lost.\u201d\nBut Sergio\u2019s projects do not stop with SERCRI \u2013 his life's dream, he says, is to set up a foundation to help more people who are deafblind. The main problem is money: \u201cI\u2019m playing the [sports betting game] La Quiniela,\u201d he jokes. But he is serious about launching a petition to call on Spain\u2019s politicians to \u201cbecome aware the difficulties that people with disabilities face.\u201d\n\u201cNo one can live off a \u20ac380 pension. Many of us have a family to support and have to spend a lot on medication and assisted-living devices. Let them think about that before they raise their salaries,\u201d he says.\nSergio also wants more time with carers. Cristina currently helps him eight hours a week. She spends three hours with him when he is at university, and the rest of the time at his home, teaching his wife and daughter SERCRI, while also reading and responding to his emails, interpreting messages and working on their platform. If he had a choice, he says, Cristina would be with him for eight hours a day.\nEnglish version by Alicia Kember.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/20/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
