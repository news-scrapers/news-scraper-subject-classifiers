Today confirms the failure of a political process, on an international level as well. It has only left pain in its wake.\u201d\nToday the good guys have won\nCiudadanos leader Albert Rivera\nS\u00e1nchez said the government would \u201cfully comply\u201d with the court\u2019s decision, which sentenced nine Catalan separatist leaders to between nine and 13 years in prison after finding them guilty of sedition in connection with the unilateral breakaway attempt two years ago this month. \u201cNo one is above the law,\u201d he added.\nThe Socialist leader said the verdict will usher in a \u201cnew stage,\u201d and promised that \u201cthe Spanish government will remain alert and will guarantee social harmony and the respect for democratic legality.\u201d\nPablo Casado, the leader of the opposition conservative Popular Party (PP), also praised the legal process as \u201cexemplary.\u201d \u201cPolitical ideas have not been judged but rather serious violations of public order,\u201d he said. Casado called on S\u00e1nchez to break all governing deals with pro-independence parties, and to promise not to offer amnesty or a government pardon to the convicted leaders.\nMeanwhile, Albert Rivera from the center-right party Ciudadanos (Citizens) has asked S\u00e1nchez to hold a meeting with so-called \u201cconstitutionalist parties\u201d \u2013 namely the PSOE, PP and Ciudadanos \u2013 to discuss the situation in Catalonia. \u201cNow is the moment to come together, not to be divided,\u201d he said. In response to the Supreme Court ruling, Rivera said: \u201cToday, the good guys have won.\u201d\nThreats, prison and punishment are not going to solve anything\nCatalan premier Quim Torra\nBut the verdict has not been so warmly welcomed by all political leaders. Pablo Iglesias, the leader of the anti-austerity party Unidas Podemos, said that the sentence \u201cwill go down in the history of Spain as a symbol of how not to address political conflicts in a democracy.\u201d In a message on Facebook, Iglesias said he wanted to \u201csend his support to the convicted leaders and to their families.\u201d He added that while he was opposed to the independence movement, he was also against \u201cdiscourses that look to criminalize Catalan men and women who peacefully protest against the sentences of their leaders.\u201d\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, the general secretary of the far-right Vox party, Javier Ortega-Smith, has criticized the Supreme Court verdict for not finding the defendants guilty of the more serious crime of rebellion, which requires an element of violence and would have entailed jail terms of up to 25 years. \u201cThere were perfectly evident acts of violence,\u201d he said.\nThe regional premier of Catalonia, Quim Torra, has rejected the Supreme Court ruling as \u201cunjust and undemocratic,\u201d and demanded amnesty for the convicted leaders. \u201cThreats, prison and punishment are not going to solve anything. This is the legacy of the dictatorship, not a sign of democracy,\u201d he said at a press conference on Monday.\nThe hardline separatist leader said he would send a letter to the caretaker prime minister and Spain\u2019s King Felipe VI to call for an urgent meeting. Torra insisted the nine independent leaders always \u201cacted peacefully,\u201d adding: \u201cTheir sacrifice will not be in vain.\u201d\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/14/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
