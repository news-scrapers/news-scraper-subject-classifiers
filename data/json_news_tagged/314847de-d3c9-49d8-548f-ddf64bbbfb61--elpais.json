Approved by the regional parliament year after year as part of the annual budget, the system allegedly enabled the fraudulent scheme to avoid oversight by the internal audit office.\nThe case became so large and unwieldy that it was broken up into 146 separate probes\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Gri\u00f1\u00e1n, who served as the PSOE\u2019s regional premier in Andalusia between 2009 and 2013, has been given six years in jail for his role in the case, while his predecessor, Manuel Chaves, also of the PSOE and who was in power between 1990 and 2009, has been barred from public office for nine years.\nWhat\u2019s more, former government minister and ex-regional economic chief Magdalena \u00c1lvarez, as well as another former regional minister, Gaspar Zarr\u00edas, have also been barred from public office for nine years.\nGri\u00f1\u00e1n, Chaves, \u00c1lvarez and Zarr\u00edas have all been convicted of the offense of prevaricaci\u00f3n, which, under Spanish law, is when a public official abuses their power by knowingly making an unfair decision. Gri\u00f1\u00e1n was also found guilty of misuse of funds.\nAs well as Gri\u00f1\u00e1n, another four ex-regional ministers have received prison terms: Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez (Employment) and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Viera (Labor), Francisco Vallejo (Innovation) and Carmen Mart\u00ednez-Aguayo (Finance). The highest sentence went to Fern\u00e1ndez, who has received a seven-year, 11-month jail term. Vallejo and Viera have been handed down seven years, and Mart\u00ednez-Aguayo six.\nOf the 21 defendants in the case, just two have been acquitted of all offenses: the regional government\u2019s former comptroller, Manuel G\u00f3mez, and the head of legal services, Francisco del R\u00edo.\nThe probe has focused on a \u20ac680-million government fund that was used to make payments between 2000 and 2009. The scandal has affected top former regional officials from the Socialist Party (PSOE), which was in power for 36 years until December 2018, when it was ousted by a right-wing coalition following regional elections.\nWith 507 people under scrutiny for nine years by as many as seven investigating judges, the case became so large and unwieldy that it was broken up into 146 separate probes. On Tuesday, a panel of three judges at the Seville Provincial Court handed down a decision in the main case that will serve as a guideline for the remaining probes.\nThere was a network of patronage involving hundreds of entrepreneurs, insurance companies, lawyers and more\nThis main case targeted former regional premiers Manuel Chaves and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gri\u00f1\u00e1n, as well as six former department chiefs and 13 other former high-ranking officials from the Andalusian government.\n\u201cThe worst part is that none of the 21 accused have any sense of having committed any crimes,\u201d said one of the lawyers shortly before the ruling was made public.\nThe trial has taken up an entire year, divided into 152 court sessions described as \u201cnever-ending\u201d by both the defense and the prosecution. The ruling runs to around 1,800 pages, making it similar in scope to the verdict in the G\u00fcrtel corruption case, which involved the conservative Popular Party (1,687 pages), and more than triple the space taken up by the Supreme Court ruling on the Catalan secession bid (493 pages).\nThe court considers both former regional premiers and the ex-ministers to be responsible for the system of public funds, as well as finding that Gri\u00f1\u00e1n \u2013 during his time as regional economy chief \u2013 was aware of reports from the Comptroller General\u2019s office that criticized the irregular subsidies, but did nothing in response.\nDefense lawyers involved in the case have already announced that they will appeal the ruling at Spain\u2019s Supreme Court, which will have the last word. None of the defendants sentenced today will see the inside of a prison cell until that top court has concluded its trial.\nThe scandal began a decade ago, when the Seville food wholesaler Mercasevilla underwent an ERE collective dismissal procedure. The police discovered that a few individuals had received early retirement payments from the government fund despite not having worked for the company.\nTheir investigation uncovered a complex system set up within the Andalusian government to channel early retirement funds to friends of the director general of the labor department, to mayors and to high-ranking PSOE officials.\nOver the years, the list of potential crimes and irregularities grew to fill two million pages. The probe was initially led by Judge Mercedes Alaya in cooperation with the Civil Guard and anti-corruption prosecutors.\nThe probe turned up public funds that had been spent on cocaine by ex-employment chief Javier Guerrero and his driver. There was also a web of ghost companies and a network of patronage involving hundreds of entrepreneurs, insurance companies, lawyers and more.\nSources involved in the case note that 85% of the money in the fund was used for legitimate purposes, chiefly early retirement payments for more than 6,000 employees. \u201cThe heavy-handed headlines about the biggest corruption case in democracy have acted like a steady drizzle that has had an effect, even though they are based on prejudice,\u201d said one lawyer who requested anonymity.\nThe ruling in the main probe of the ERE case, which has been used by the PP to counter accusations of corruption over its own G\u00fcrtel scandal, comes as Spain\u2019s political parties attempt to forge agreements that will allow the formation of a government following the repeat election of November 10.\nThe chief justice of Andalusia\u2019s regional High Court, Lorenzo del R\u00edo, on Thursday denied allegations that the decision was held back until after the election to avoid hurting the PSOE. \u201cIt is not true that it was deliberately delayed, it\u2019s only now that the drafting of the ruling is being completed,\u201d he said, calling it \u201cone of the most complicated [rulings] in Spain\u2019s judicial history.\u201d\nBesides the prison terms and other penalties for the defendants, the effects of the ERE case are also symbolic, since Manuel Chaves and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gri\u00f1\u00e1n presided Andalusia for 23 out of the 36 years that the PSOE governed the region uninterruptedly.\n\u201cThe ERE case has been like a stone weighing heavily on Andalusia,\u201d said Juan Mar\u00edn, the Andalusian leader of the center-right party Ciudadanos. \u201cIt\u2019s done a lot of damage. And those responsible are all with the PSOE.\u201d\nEl\u00edas Bendodo, a department chief with the PP, said that \u201can era is ending in Andalusia: there\u2019s going to be a before and an after.\u201d\n\u201cThe damage is done, this ruling will not fix what\u2019s broken,\u201d added Teresa Rodr\u00edguez, of the leftist Adelante Andaluc\u00eda. \u201cThere is a lack of trust that will not be restored for decades.\u201d\nEnglish version by Susana Urra and Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/19/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
