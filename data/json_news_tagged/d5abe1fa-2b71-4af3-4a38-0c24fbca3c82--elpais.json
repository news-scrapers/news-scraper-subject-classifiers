Why more class time has not improved academic results in Spain\n\nA student at a Spanish high school receives 1,045 hours of class time a year \u2013 246 more than a Finnish student (808) \u2013 but performs worse on average on the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) test, according to the report Education at a Glance 2019, from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\nWhen countries improve the quality of their teaching, they tend to achieve better results without increasing the learning time\nAndreas Schleicher, head of PISA test\nThe study, which was released on Tuesday, ranks Spain in the middle in terms of academic performance, while Finland is an international leader in secondary school education. Greece is the European country with the fewest hours of class time (791) and has mediocre PISA results. But Sweden, Norway and Japan have similar class hours and are among the best-ranked academically.\nSpain has more class time than the EU average (893 hours) and the OECD average (910). The country also has more lessons in language, mathematics and foreign languages than the OECD average. The difference in class time is also evident at the primary school level, but is less pronounced. Spain has 792 hours of class, 23 more than the EU average and nine more than the OECD average.\nAndreas Schleicher, the head of PISA Tests, is clear: more class time does not guarantee a better education. \u201cWhen countries improve the quality of their teaching, they tend to achieve better results without increasing the learning time of the student.\u201d For example, Japanese students study 41 hours a week (28 in the classroom and 14 extracurricular) and Korean students spend 50 hours studying (30 hours in the classroom and 20 extracurricular), but their academic results are very similar.\nIn Tunisia and the four Chinese provinces where PISA exams are taken, students study for 30 hours in the classroom and 28 outside. But although they spend the same amount of time studying, there is a stark difference in their science results \u2013 Tunisia scored 367 points and China 530 points.\nPISA is a test from the OECD that is given every three years to 15-year-old students in both private and public schools from all over the world. The exam tests the students in reading, mathematics and science. Over half a million 15-year-olds from 80 countries and economies took the PISA test in 2018.\nAlejandro Tiana, Spain\u2019s education secretary of state, has invited the education community to discuss the allocation of school hours. \u201cWe have to reflect about how school time is used in Spain,\u201d he said.\nRaimundo de los Reyes, the head of FEDADI, the federation that brings together the leaders of public secondary schools, believes students in Spain study for too many hours \u2013 six hours in class plus three or four hours on homework, projects and other school activities. \u201cThat is longer than the working day of many employees.\u201d\n\u201cI would do away with 10 hours if in exchange we had fewer students in the classroom and could give them more personalized attention. We need resources, more assistant teachers, and to give more time for teachers to prepare all classes, not just the ones in English,\u201d he added.\nMaribel Loranca, the head of education at the UGT trade union, agrees class time should be cut, arguing long hours \u201ctake away time from attention for families, personal treatment and innovation.\u201d\nMeanwhile, PISA experts warn that Spain will not improve its academic performance until students spend more time on finding their own solutions to problems and less on memorizing information.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/13/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
