In accordance to Spanish legislation, there is now a two-month countdown for a candidate to step up with a new bid before parliament is dissolved and fresh elections called.\nS\u00e1nchez never wanted a coalition government with Podemos\nSources at the PSOE said that in the coming weeks S\u00e1nchez will try to assemble the majority he needs to mount a new investiture bid: 176 affirmative votes, or more yes than no votes in a second round.\nBut after the leftist Unidas Podemos last week rejected S\u00e1nchez\u2019s last offer of three ministerial positions and a deputy PM spot \u2013 the anti-austerity group said these posts lacked any effective power \u2013 there will be no further offers for Cabinet positions, said government sources.\nOn Friday, acting Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said the Socialist would not negotiate a coalition government with Unidas Podemos. \u201cThis path is no longer open,\u201c she explained. \u201cIt is time to explore other scenarios to avoid elections.\u201d\nSenior Socialist officials said that there are also differences of opinion between the PSOE and Unidas Podemos over the budget allocations for social spending, as well as over economic issues and the Catalan crisis.\nAbove all, S\u00e1nchez never wanted a coalition government with Podemos, which has 42 seats in Congress, but rather a single-party administration with a few independents, said sources familiar with the early talks between both groups.\nIf Spaniards are asked to go to the polls again, nobody knows who will benefit the most. Socialist sources said that voters might be weary of the stalemate and show more support for the two traditional parties, the Popular Party (PP) and the PSOE, to the detriment of the newer groups (Podemos and the center-right Ciudadanos).\nThe Socialists won the April 28 election with 123 seats, far short of an overall majority, and the country has been under a caretaker administration since then. Before that, S\u00e1nchez had been leading a minority government since June 2018, when he led a successful no-confidence motion against Mariano Rajoy of the PP.\nWhile Spaniards wait to see whether they are asked to go to the polls for a record fifth time this year (there were national, regional, local and European elections earlier this year), Europe is also watching closely.\nBut \u201cEurope is accustomed to this sort of situation,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares, 47, a career diplomat who works as secretary general for international affairs and acts as S\u00e1nchez\u2019s top advisor on foreign issues.\nBelgium is immersed in a process that will be longer than Spain\u2019s, and it took Merkel six months to form her government\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Albares\n\u201cIt is not unusual. Belgium is immersed in a process that will be longer than Spain\u2019s, and it took [Angela] Merkel six months to form her government after the elections... What Europe appreciates is Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s solid leadership, his commitment to Europe and his desire for a strong, efficient government,\u201d he says.\nAlbares says that S\u00e1nchez was a key figure at the recent negotiations for EU institutional positions, which \u201crequired crafting agreements between three political families and 28 member states, while cordoning off the far right so it would not occupy any positions of power from which to undermine the EU\u2019s values.\u201d\n\u201cIf this was possible in Europe, why would it not be possible in Spain? It\u2019s true that [Spain] has joined the democratic game later than others, and maybe some parties have not properly assimilated a negotiating capacity, but it is hard to believe that Pedro S\u00e1nchez should be able to do it abroad and not here.\u201d\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "07/29/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
