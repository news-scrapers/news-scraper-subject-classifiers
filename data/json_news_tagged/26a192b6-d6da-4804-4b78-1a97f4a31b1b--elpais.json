I have to dodge a massive construction container before entering probably one of the most elite food shops in the area. The smell of rotting waste as I walk by the container, which is filled with much more than its designated items, is unbearable. But as I walk into the earthy-looking grocery store, a pleasant smell of freshness quickly wafts over me. I can immediately sense the \u201ceco-friendly\u201d vibe, reflected in the handmade baskets and tote bags reading \u201cI Am Green\u201d and \u201cSave Earth.\u201d\n\u201cWe give our customers the option between plastic or brown paper bags, but most of them bring their own, so it seems they are quite environmentally friendly,\u201d says the man behind the till.\nWe are interrupted by the woman next in line. She is holding a big plastic bag filled with grapes. Just behind her is a younger woman holding a yoga mat under her arm and a tote bag reading \u201cSay NO to plastic.\u201d\nIt is witnessing situations like these that made me question how environmentally conscious people are, especially in hip Gr\u00e0cia, and whether this fa\u00e7ade of \u201csustainable\u201d living is just an extension of the health trend in Barcelona or if people are truly concerned for the planet.\nA study by the European Investment Bank found that 87% of Spaniards are worried or alarmed by global warming and 70% of them believe climate change is a threat to humanity. This is higher than the EU average.\nHowever, in 2018, Spanish homes threw out nearly 1.4 billion liters of food, with 84% of products tossed in the bin without having been cooked. This leaves Spain far from its UN Sustainable Development goal to halve food waste by 2030.\nI love the \u2018green\u2019 lifestyle, but I also am truly concerned for the planet\nGr\u00e0cia local resident\nNot far down the street, I walk into Gra de Gr\u00e0cia, one of the neighborhood\u2019s most popular a granel stores. A granel businesses offer bulk buying with no packaging. Also known as \u201czero waste\u201d stores, these have nearly become the norm, selling everything from food produce and toiletries, to detergents, all by the kilo or liter.\n\u201cIt is both egoistic and for the environment. I love the \u2018green\u2019 lifestyle, but I also am truly concerned for the planet,\u201d says a local resident while filling her glass jars with nuts and wholemeal pasta. \u201cThere is too much pollution, too much waste, and the City Hall does nothing about it.\u201d\nMy visit to\u00a0Gra de Gr\u00e0cia turns into an interesting discussion between the customers and salesmen.\n\u201cWith these zero-waste businesses, we are starting to make a difference and people are attracted to the lifestyle, especially in Gr\u00e0cia. But I think they are still not fully conscious of how our behavior impacts the environment, so for the moment it\u2019s probably more of a lifestyle trend,\u201d the sales assistant told me.\nEight out of 10 people I spoke to admitted they weren\u2019t fully committed to recycling at home. When I asked them if the city motivated them to lead a more \u201csustainable\u201d lifestyle, they all replied no. They were, however, shopping \u201czero waste.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a lack of transparency in the system,\u201d says Daniel, a local resident. \u201cI think there is an illusion of sustainability that comforts us as individuals and a society.\u201d\nIn 2018, Spanish homes threw out nearly 1.4 billion liters of food\n\u201cThe City Hall talks and talks, they say they want to cut the traffic, they say they will provide us with recycling bins, but they don\u2019t do anything. They don\u2019t think about the people and they don\u2019t give us the solutions we need,\u201d another local resident tells me.\nInspired and with my interest piqued by the people I spoke with, I went on to the City Hall\u2019s Environment and Sustainability website. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of information the site offers on air quality, waste management and green living.\nBut as I look into more details, I find an outdated video ending with a phrase reading: \u201cThe objective is to reduce waste per capita by 10% by 2018\u2026 There is no more time to lose.\u201d\nOn my visit to Gr\u00e0cia\u2019s central food market, I spoke to a butcher.\n\u201cWe recycle everything and make sure we produce as little waste as possible. But then, who knows what happens with our recycling. That\u2019s a whole other business, everything in this city is a business \u2013 even sustainability.\u201d\n NEWSLETTER \n Recibe la mejor informaci\u00f3n en tu bandeja de entrada \nUna breve gu\u00eda para que el hombre moderno (o sea, t\u00fa) sepa c\u00f3mo regalar joyas estas navidades evitando compras fallidas de \u00faltima hora y triste desaciertos.
