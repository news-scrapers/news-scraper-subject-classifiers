The Cabinet will analyze these measures, identify weak points, and determine whether new steps are required in light of the most recent developments.\nSpain is particularly affected by Brexit, as Britain is its main source of tourists, as well as the top destination for Spanish investment\nThis will be the first time that the leader of the Socialist Party (PSOE) administration has brought all of his ministers together to determine how to mitigate the most adverse effects of a no-deal Brexit.\nIn March, his government passed a decree containing measures to deal with these effects. \u201cThe goal of the plans is to preserve the rights of Spanish and British citizens, as well as preserving a normal trade flow and safeguarding Spanish economic interests,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez at the time. \u201cMy main goal was to guarantee that the UK\u2019s decision [to leave the EU] would have the smallest possible impact on citizens and businesses.\u201d\nUntil now, these meetings had only involved ministries that are part of a Brexit Committee headed by acting Deputy PM Carmen Calvo. But the approaching deadline for the UK\u2019s departure and the ongoing uncertainty of the political situation in Britain have led the Spanish government leader to convene all of his ministers.\nThe March decree, which was later ratified by Congress, covers the most sensitive areas for Spain. Citizens are the greatest concern, particularly the approximately 300,000 British nationals who are officially living in Spain, representing the biggest UK community abroad. The measures guarantee access to public health services, take social security contributions into account, and recognize driver\u2019s licenses and academic studies, among other issues.\nThe Spanish decree also contemplated police cooperation between Spain and the UK\nBeyond this decree, S\u00e1nchez signed a reciprocity agreement with former British PM Theresa May to ensure that the 175,000 Spaniards living in the UK receive similar benefits. But the current uncertainty casts doubt as to whether that deal will be preserved.\nThe Spanish decree also contemplated police cooperation between Spain and the UK, and reinforced border controls to deal with imported goods coming in from Britain.\nSpain is particularly affected by Brexit, as Britain is its main source of tourist visitors, as well as being the top destination for Spanish investment. British companies are the third-largest buyers of Spanish goods and services. And then there is the complex issue of Gibraltar, the British Overseas Territory located in the south of the Iberian peninsula that Spain has long demanded be returned to its sovereignty, and which voted overwhelmingly to remain within the EU.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/05/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
