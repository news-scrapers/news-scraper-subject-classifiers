The scam was run by three lawyers, with the help of Leonor S\u00e1nchez-Caballero, a top official at the Spanish Tax Agency.\nS\u00e1nchez-Caballero used her access to tax data to alert the lawyers to the foreign sportspeople who had left Spanish teams without requesting their IRPF refund, either out of ignorance of the entitlement or because they had forgotten to do so. The top tax official then provided the names and tax details of the players to her cohorts, who forged the players\u2019 signatures and completed the paperwork to request the refund. Sources from the investigation say that the criminal network gave S\u00e1nchez-Caballero gifts and paid for vacations to entice her into looking for potential victims.\nIn 2015, the lawyers requested a tax refund of \u20ac94,700 by falsifying the signature of a sports player resident in the United Kingdom\nThe tax official became involved in the scam thanks to her ex-husband Juan Ignacio Torrontegui, who, together with Julio Lapausa Verdial and Manuel Val Jim\u00e9nez, is one of the three lawyers under investigation. According to prosecutors, the lawyers presented the Tax Agency with the forged documentation to request the refund. This included residency certificates and proof of the income tax deducted by the sports clubs, as well as the bank details of where the money should be paid. S\u00e1nchez-Caballero was in charge of looking at the details of the players\u2019 prior tax returns, so that the documentation would be as authentic as possible and not ring any alarm bells with the Tax Agency.\nOn February 23, 2015, the lawyers requested a tax refund of \u20ac94,700 by falsifying the signature of a sports player, who in this case was a tax resident of the United Kingdom, and later that year, another \u20ac209,896 pretending to be a player resident in Brazil. The network also falsified tax residency certificates from Turkey, Uruguay, Russia, Portugal, France and Mexico, as well as tax withholding certificates from sports clubs such as Rayo Vallecano, Getafe and Mallorca. To appropriate the money, the accused used signatures from the sports consultancy firms Lapver and Star Athletes Society.\nThe Madrid court and the public prosecutor for financial crimes have been investigating the scam for two years. In the written accusation, the prosecutor has called for each of the lawyers to be sentenced to nine years in prison, and for S\u00e1nchez-Caballero to be given 11 years and a five-year ban from public office. As well as jail time, the accused are also facing fines of more than \u20ac18 million.\nThe prosecutor has contacted the soccer and basketball players affected by the scam, who say they never requested the refund nor do they know any of the members of the criminal network.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/10/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
