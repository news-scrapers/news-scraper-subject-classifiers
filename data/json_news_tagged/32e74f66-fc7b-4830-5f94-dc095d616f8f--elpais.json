Torres underscored the defendant\u2019s \u201ccomplete lack of scruples\u201d as he addressed the seven women and two men who make up the jury that will decide Quezada\u2019s fate.\nTorres told the court that he has been speaking with Gabriel\u2019s parents, \u00c1ngel Cruz and Patricia Ram\u00edrez, every single day for these last 18 months. \u201cIt is impossible to describe their pain,\u201d he said. The parents, who will provide testimony at a closed-door hearing on Tuesday, are still in treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.\nThe case attracted international media attention after Gabriel went missing from his grandmother\u2019s house in N\u00edjar, inside the Cabo de Gata national park, on February 27, 2018. A huge search operation got underway, in which Quezada actively participated, making regular appeals on television for his safe return. Around two weeks later, the police arrested her as she attempted to move the child\u2019s body in the trunk of her car.\nAt the trial on Monday, Torres said that Quezada took Gabriel from his grandmother\u2019s house when the father was not around, and drove him to a secluded family property in Rodalquilar that they were renovating. It was there that she attacked him.\n\u201cThen she smoked a few cigarettes, painted a door, dug the grave, and an hour later realized that Gabriel was still breathing and strangled him,\u201d said Torres.\nSitting next to her lawyers, Quezada shook her head and dried tears from her eyes during the court session. A hairdresser who moved to Spain from Dominican Republic in her twenties and lived in Burgos before settling down in Almer\u00eda, she confessed to the crime soon after her arrest.\nHer defense lawyer, Esteban Hern\u00e1ndez, on Monday asked the jury for \u201cgood sense\u201d in this \u201ctragic matter,\u201d and insisted that the main issue is to determine \u201cwhether she was aiming to kill him, or just wanted him to be quiet.\u201d The evidence, he says, confirms his client\u2019s claim that the child picked up an ax to play with, and that when she reprimanded him, he insulted her. She then covered his mouth, and later realized he was not breathing.\n\u201cIt is our understanding that she had no intention of causing harm,\u201d he said. As for Quezada\u2019s behavior afterwards \u2013 she participated in the search operation and planted one of his shirts to draw attention to the wrong spot \u2013 her lawyer said it was \u201cquite common.\u201d\nE. P.\nIn April 2018, investigating judge Rafael Soriano noted in his decision to deny Quezada bail that \u201cthe evidence reveals a lack of feeling and humanity that she herself recognizes, and which, if confirmed, would represent pure cruelty.\u201d\nThe investigating judge also noted that during the search, she \u201cgave a false appearance of concern for the disappearance and fate of the boy\u201d and \u201ckept up the show, going even further and pretending to find a shirt belonging to the boy.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you do something wrong, you don\u2019t announce it,\u201d he said. He is seeking a conviction for reckless homicide, which entails a maximum prison sentence of 15 years.\nBut the public prosecutor, Elena Fern\u00e1ndez, said that Quezada \u201cdeprived the child of life in cold blood and with absolute contempt.\u201d She used the words \u201cpretense,\u201d \u201cmanipulation,\u201d \u201cdeceit,\u201d and \u201coveracting\u201d to describe the defendant\u2019s behavior during the search operation.\nOn Tuesday morning, Quezada took the stand and confirmed that she killed Gabriel. Asked by the public prosecutor Elena Fern\u00e1ndez Lora whether she \u201cended the life of the son of your partner,\u201d she answered: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI saw Gabriel with an ax. I told him, \u2018Put it down, you could hurt yourself.\u2019 He started to scream, \u2018You can\u2019t boss me around, you\u2019re not my mother. You\u2019re black, you\u2019re ugly, your nose is ugly, I don\u2019t want you to be with my father. I want my father to marry my mother. I want you to go back to your country\u2019,\u201d the defendant told the court.\n\u201cI simply covered his mouth, I didn\u2019t want to hurt the child. I just wanted him to be quiet. I didn\u2019t want to kill the child,\u201d she said.\nAs for the shirt belonging to the child that she planted in a bid to throw the Civil Guard off the trail, Quezada said that she had left it there because she wanted to be arrested. \u201cI wanted to get caught, because I was unable to say it with my own words, I wanted them to apprehend me,\u201d she told the court.\nDozens of witnesses and experts have been summoned to the provincial court of Almer\u00eda, where the trial is scheduled to end on September 19 after nine sessions.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/10/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
