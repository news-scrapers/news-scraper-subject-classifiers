But that was a difficult goal to achieve in Gambia, a country the 29-year-old fled from in order to escape the regime of dictator Yahya Jammeh. \u201cI left Africa through Libya in 2013. From there I traveled to Italy and then to Switzerland. In 2015, I arrived in Spain,\u201d he says in perfect English. Even though Touray speaks French, six African languages, and is learning Spanish, and that he gained computing experience while in Switzerland, he has been unable to find proper work in Spain. Like many of his compatriots, he tries to survive with what he makes as a mantero, the term used for street vendors who sell goods in public spaces on large blankets, or mantas. This kind of business is known as top manta.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like working in top manta. It\u2019s not what I want to do, but I don\u2019t have a choice. I\u2019m on the street because nobody gives me an opportunity to do something else,\u201d he explains. But his luck might be about to change.\nTouray has been selected, along with six other street vendors, in the first modeling audition for Topmantatopmodel, a not-for-profit Spanish initiative that offers these young men the chance to show off their talent as models and performers. Under the slogan \u201cFrom Sidewalk to Catwalk,\u201d the project aims to connect the aspiring models with brands in search of models with similar profiles. The program is being led by publicist and creative director Juli\u00e1n Zuazo, alongside Susanne Pfingsten and a team of well-known professionals from the film, advertising and fashion industries. Together they have put together the first of many videos designed to showcase the modeling skills of these young men.\nAccording to Zuazo, the idea was inspired by the difficulty of finding black models in Spain. \u201cI have always had to look for them outside of the country, in New York or Los Angeles, but one day as I was walking down the street, I realized we had them right here,\u201d he explains. The realization prompted him to create a website that could connect brands with aspiring models. \u201cThe web page features their photos, a short biography and a contact number so they can call them directly. We provide support and legal advice so they can enter into a project-based contract,\u201d says Pfingsten, who is in charge of communication.\n\u201cWe work with an expert immigration lawyer who is in contact with the Secretary of State for Migrations, Consuelo Rum\u00ed, and who manages everything from a legal point of view. There is a section in Spanish law that allows an undocumented foreigner to be contracted as long as a Spaniard is not able to do the same job. Given that there are not many two-meter tall black Spaniards around, we are not taking work away from anyone and everyone wins,\u201d explains Pfingsten.\nSpanish fashion labels like Garc\u00eda Madrid, Lola Li, The Beest and Mariana Barturen have supported the program, dressing the six men for the first video of the campaign.\n\n\u201cBeing a model has always been my dream, but I never had the opportunity. In Gambia, it wasn\u2019t easy to get to an audition and I didn\u2019t even have the right clothes for it. When I did the photo and video session with Topmantatopmodel, I felt really good, really comfortable. This type of project is really important to us because we don\u2019t have options. Hopefully, my dream will finally become a reality,\u201d says Touray. In the video, he appears with six other street vendors and four migrant dancers (Miriem, Grace, Yanis and Yonaria), who can also be contacted on the website.\nAbdou Sakhor, from Senegal, arrived in Spain from Morocco after crossing on a small boat where he almost lost his life. He was also included in the first casting, as was Mama Gore, also from Senegal, who like Sakhor crossed the Mediterranean Sea with the hope of helping his family financially. Now his goal is to \u201cleave behind the life of a mantero, which is dangerous, hard and painful.\u201d The stories of the other participants Bamba, Dieumba Cisse and Cheick are very similar: all of them left their countries in search of a better future.\n\u201cIt might be difficult to reach the same level of success as Adut Akech, the refugee model who has posed for Chanel among others, but we want them to feel part of our society whether or not they are working in the industry. Our goal is also to change how people see them and to get to know them,\u201d says Zuazo.\nAccording to the creative director, the street vendors had no trouble moving and posing like real models, Tthey were very committed,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey remembered their past and they couldn\u2019t believe they were now filming a video. They felt important. They don\u2019t want compassion, but rather to be in a place they deserve.\u201d\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/02/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
