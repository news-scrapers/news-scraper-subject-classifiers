Frankfurt and Paris also retreated significantly, while London did so to a lesser degree.\nThese losses come after US President Donald Trump issued new warnings to China over a trade deal, and concern grew over the future relationship between Britain and the European Union.\nThe continent\u2019s main stock exchanges closed down after the UK\u2019s new prime minister, Boris Johnson, continued to warn about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. This announcement led to the pound\u2019s biggest monthly drop since late 2016, closing on Tuesday at 1.09 against the euro.\nThe Spanish blue-chip index slid to 8,986.6 points, partly also because of emerging news about the country\u2019s second-biggest bank, BBVA.\nIAG, the parent company of Iberia, British Airways, Vueling and Aer Lingus, shed 5.96% on Tuesday, to become the Ibex 35\u2019s second worst-performing share yesterday. The company is currently immersed in a complicated process to prove to EU authorities that Iberia is a Spanish company and avoid the risks of a no-deal Brexit.\nBanco Santander, which does a lot of business in the UK, also experienced a bad day with losses of 3.71%. And Banco Sabadell, which also operates in Britain, gave up 3.37% on a day when every single listed share on the Ibex 35 closed in the red. Only Indra and Grifols managed to keep their losses below 1%.\nThe worst performer with losses of up to 17.65% was Siemens Gamesa, although it had little to do with the global outlook. Instead, the plunge followed an announcement by the multinational wind turbine maker that its earnings margin was below the forecast figure.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "07/31/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
