Time magazine recently published a photograph of that event, triggering a wave of criticism from social and political leaders. \u201cBlackface is part of a history of dehumanization, of denied citizenship [...]. It is time to stop with the dismissive arguments of those that describe these offensive acts as pranks, ignorance and youthful indiscretions,\u201d writes David Leonard, an associate professor of culture, gender and race studies at Washington State University, in an article in The Huffington Post. Trudeau has since apologized.\nIn Spain, the NGO SOS Racismo defines blackface or brownface as \u201ca practice that perpetuates racism toward black people by ridiculing and exaggerating their traits, using makeup that simulates black skin and Afro wigs.\u201d\nTo Americans, it\u2019s more obvious. Here, it is passed off as a joke\nAntumi Toasij\u00e9, historian\nIn Spain, some people have drawn parallels between the actions of the Canadian leader and an annual tradition in many Spanish towns: white people who paint their skin black every January 5 to play King Balthazar in the Three Kings parade, which recreates the biblical tale of the Magi\u2019s journey to visit the baby Jesus in Bethlehem.\nIn 2014, then-Madrid Mayor Ana Botella was asked why a white person in blackface was playing the character of King Balthazar in the parade. \u201cIf we had a black city councilor, there would certainly be no problem with having a black king,\u201d she replied, alluding to the long-held practice of selecting three city councilors to play the roles of the Three Wise Men.\nMany US media outlets have traced the practice back to the 19th century, but Spain has many instances of blackface in plays dating back to the Golden Age, spanning approximately from the mid-1500s to the mid-1600s. At that time, white actors would go up on stage wearing dark makeup.\nPajes negros de L'@AjuntamentAlcoi, os decimos #alcoistopblackface porque el blackface es un ejemplo m\u00e1s de cosificaci\u00f3n, humillaci\u00f3n y despersonalizaci\u00f3n de personas afrodescendientes en Espa\u00f1a y tiene un trasfondo colonial. Es racismo. https://t.co/hOfxrIaSEH v\u00eda @Afrofeminas\nBlack pages of the city of Alcoy, we tell you #alcoistopblackface because blackface is another example of how people of African descent in Spain are treated as objects, humiliated and dehumanized, and it has a colonial element. It is racism.\n\u201cWe can see instances of blackface right there. After the Muslims were expelled from the Iberian peninsula, this was a way of ridiculing them through public performances. It coincided with a rise in the number of enslaved people from Africa,\u201d says Antumi Toasij\u00e9, a historian and director of the Kituo cha Wanafrika Pan-African Studies Center.\nIn the 1500s and 1600s, actors would darken their faces with burnt cork. \u201cBlack people were portrayed as lascivious, or as having funny-sounding accents,\u201d adds the historian, noting that there were sometimes also black actors in these plays, but that they normally played the same stereotyped roles played by white actors in blackface. \u201cIt was a very popular, insulting type of comedy,\u201d says Toasij\u00e9.\nThe head of this research center feels that the biggest case of blackface in Spain these days is the Three Kings parade in Alcoy, in Alicante province. The event has been held since 1885, making it the oldest in Spain, and hundreds of locals paint their faces black and their lips red to represent black pages accompanying the kings of Orient. \u201cThey represent enslaved people. Alcoy is the spot in Spain with the most massive case of blackface,\u201d says Toasij\u00e9.\nThe Alcoy parade has been officially designated as a cultural asset (BIC) and as an event of national interest for tourism. \u201cWe are not being disrespectful, this is not blackface or a manifestation of racism,\u201d said the local councilor in charge of the festivity in statements to Eldiario.es ahead of the latest parade.\nWe are not being disrespectful, this is not blackface or a manifestation of racism\nAlcoy city official\nToasij\u00e9 thinks that Spaniards are still not fully aware of the racist component of blackface. \u201cSpanish society is different to American society. While there is racism and racist violence here, the degree of social aggressiveness [against black people] is not the same as in the United States. To Americans, it\u2019s more obvious. Here, it is passed off as a joke.\u201d\nIn December 2017, the soccer player Antoine Griezmann, who was then with Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid, shared a photograph on social media where he was seen wearing blackface makeup and an Afro wig, in an attempt to look like a basketball player. The occasion was a costume party where the theme was the 1980s. The French player ended up deleting the picture after receiving negative comments on social media and complaints from several organizations.\n\u201cI think that social media have helped create a bigger impact for our demands,\u201d says Toasij\u00e9. And even though protests by Spain\u2019s community of African descent have failed to introduce changes to the Alcoy parade, many other cases have been successful. In Madrid, for instance, a black person played King Balthazar at the 2015 Three Kings parade.\n\u201cThere are still a few parades that do blackface, but they are fewer and fewer,\u201d notes Toasij\u00e9. \u201cBut you still see the odd Balthazar in blackface makeup at schools.\u201d\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/24/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
