Their testimonies have been published by the Associated Press (AP), which said that only one of the accusers, the retired mezzo-soprano Patricia Wulf, agreed to go on the record, while the others withheld their identities for fear of reprisals.\nSeven women said they felt their careers had been hurt after refusing Domingo\u2019s advances\nThe news agency reported that the Madrid-born tenor and opera director allegedly harassed young women who were starting their careers, offering jobs in exchange for sexual favors and professionally punishing those who refused his advances.\nThe alleged events took place over the course of three decades, starting in the late 1980s, said the AP. None of the women could offer documentation to back up their accusations, but the AP \u201cindependently verified that the women worked where they said they did and that Domingo overlapped with them at those locations.\u201d\nDomingo responded in a statement: \u201cIt is painful to hear that I may have upset anyone or made them feel uncomfortable\u00a0\u2013 no matter how long ago and despite my best intentions.\u201d\nAfter calling the accusations \u201cinaccurate,\u201d Domingo added that \u201cI recognize that the rules and standards by which we are\u00a0\u2013 and should be\u00a0\u2013 measured against today are very different than they were in the past.\u201d\nThe 78-year-old Domingo is one of the most admired tenors of all time, and a powerful figure in the world of classical music. He has sung 150 roles in over 4,000 performances, continues to sing, and also works as the director of the Los Angeles Opera. He famously teamed up with Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras to form the popular trio known as The Three Tenors in the 1990s and early 2000s.\nEight singers and a dancer told the AP that they were harassed by Domingo, whose attitude towards women was \u201can open secret\u201d in the world of opera. One of them said he stuck his hand down her skirt, and three more said he forced kisses on them at business lunches, dressing rooms and hotel rooms.\nTwo of the women said they finally agreed to have sex with Domingo because they felt they could not refuse the most powerful man in their line of work\nAnother half a dozen women said Domingo made overtures that made them feel uncomfortable, including insistent phone calls to ask them out on dates.\nSeven women said they felt their careers had been hurt after refusing Domingo\u2019s advances. The AP spoke with \u201calmost three dozen\u201d other people from the world of opera, who confirmed that \u201cthey witnessed inappropriate sexually tinged behavior by Domingo and that he pursued younger women with impunity.\u201d\nTwo of the women said they finally agreed to have sex with Domingo because they felt they could not refuse the most powerful man in their line of work.\nMany women said that colleagues warned them never to be alone with the tenor, not even in an elevator. \u201cThere is an oral tradition of warning women against Pl\u00e1cido Domingo,\u201d said a mezzo-soprano who worked at the LA Opera but is not among the accusers, the AP reported.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/13/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
