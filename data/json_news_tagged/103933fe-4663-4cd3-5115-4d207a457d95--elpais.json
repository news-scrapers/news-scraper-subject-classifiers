There were also serious clashes in Girona, Lleida and Tarragona. Thirty-three people were arrested and 100 required medical attention\nTorra, however, seemed determined to use the street protests against the Supreme Court ruling to build momentum for the independence movement, even though less than 10% of Catalan people believe this is the correct route, according to the regional government\u2019s own surveys. Indeed, many of Torra\u2019s councilors have been much more explicit about condemning the violence.\nIn the end, the Catalan premier finally decided to criticize the street unrest in a short televised message on Wednesday night. \u201cThe independence movement is not and has never been violent. We have always condemned and will condemn violence,\u201d said Torra. \u201cWe cannot allow groups of infiltrators and provocateurs to destroy the image of the independence movement, we cannot fall into the trap,\u201d he said, in reference to his claim that the violence was being caused by outsiders seeking to damage the reputation of the pro-independence movement.\nTorra\u2019s delayed response to the violence has sparked renewed calls for his resignation\nBut Torra\u2019s delayed response to the violence has sparked renewed calls for his resignation. At an extraordinary meeting on Thursday, the leader of the Catalan branch of the Socialist Party (PSC), Miquel Iceta, argued Torra was \u201cputting [Catalan] independence above social harmony\u201d and should call new elections. This call was backed by the spokesperson of the center-right party Ciudadanos (Citizens), Lorena Rold\u00e1n, who said Torra should \u201cstop fooling the Catalan people.\u201d\nTorra, for his part, has refused to stand down and maintained that he will continue to fight for an independent Catalan republic. \u201cI will defend to the end of this term that we exercise our right to self-determination again. We will do it again [...] No court will stop this Catalan premier from opening these debates,\u201d he said.\nCaretaker PM S\u00e1nchez met with the leaders of the opposition on Thursday to discuss a solution to the conflict in Catalonia. But with a fresh general election coming up on November 10, reaching consensus appeared to be out of the question.\nPablo Casado, of the conservative Popular Party (PP), wants the government to activate the National Security Law in Catalonia, a piece of legislation that lets \u201cthe relevant authorities contribute the necessary human and material resources\u201d to maintain public order, as well as Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which would strip Catalonia of its autonomous powers. This article was invoked by former PP Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in response to the 2017 unilateral declaration of independence.\nLike Casado, Albert Rivera, from Ciudadanos, wants Article 155 to be activated immediately in order to oust Torra from power, while Pablo Iglesias, leader of the leftist anti-austerity party Unidas Podemos, has called for dialogue.\nS\u00e1nchez, however, warned that the government \u201cwas not going to overreact\u201d to the situation in Catalonia.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/17/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
