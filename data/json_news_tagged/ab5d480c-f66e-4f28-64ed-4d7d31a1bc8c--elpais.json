A similar governing arrangement is in place in the southern region of Andalusia.\n\u201cIt is a challenge, an honor and a privilege to preside the first coalition government,\u201d said Ayuso. \u201cDepartment heads from one party will have to carry out measures from the other party, and vice-versa. It will be a great exercise in responsibility, common sense and respect for citizens.\u201d\nThe governing agreement has been reached two and a half months after regional elections were held on May 26, reflecting the increased complexity of Spanish politics following the emergence of new parties such as Vox, Ciudadanos and the leftist Podemos.\nOn Wednesday, Ayuso told lawmakers at the Madrid assembly that she will honor her party\u2019s program agreements with Ciudadanos and Vox \u201cin their entirety.\u201d The conservative politician needed these parties\u2019 votes to be confirmed as the new leader of the Madrid region.\nThis public statement had been a request of Vox\u2019s, since no signed document exists following Ciudadanos\u2019 refusal to engage with the far-right party directly.\nLeaders of leftist parties on Wednesday questioned many of Ayuso\u2019s plans for the coming term, and reminded her of the PP\u2019s history of corruption cases.\n\u201cLowering taxes at the expense of increasing debt, like [your party] has been doing, without improving public services, was a mistake and will continue to be so,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Gabilondo of the Socialist Party (PSOE).\nIsabel Serra of the far-left Unidas Podemos struck a more personal note, asking Ayuso if she thinks it will be long before she is prosecuted for her alleged role in a case involving a loan for her father that went unpaid.\nVox\u2019s Roc\u00edo Monasterio, meanwhile, told the PP and Ciudadanos that they are here to \u201cclean the cesspool\u201d and made renewed calls for streamlining government (which will in fact grow from nine to 13 departments). \u201cWe are aware of our political strength in this assembly. Only through alliances with parties that defend the same concept of freedom as ourselves can we prevent the left from entering the institutions.\u201d\n\u201cYour fear is not losing freedom, your fear is losing power,\u201d said Gabilondo, alluding to the fact that the PP has governed the region uninterruptedly since 1995. On May 26, the Socialists earned more seats, 37 to the PP\u2019s 30, but support from Ciudadanos and Vox will ensure that the conservatives remain at the helm.\nThe measures that Ayuso will incorporate at Vox\u2019s request include forcing public schools to inform parents about the subject matter of workshops and expert talks before the beginning of each academic year; changing the way unaccompanied underage migrants are identified, working to increase the birth rate through a new Family department, and \u201cfighting sexism but not fighting men.\u201d\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/14/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
