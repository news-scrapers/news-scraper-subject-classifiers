The local government, which is run by a coalition between the conservative Popular Party (PP) and center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) with the support of far-right Vox, will also sterilize the eggs of this invasive species, which is aggressive and is affecting native birds such as sparrows.\nWe don\u2019t know what could happen if we don\u2019t manage to reduce the population\nSantiago Soria Carreras, head of the Biodiversity Service at Madrid City Hall\nThe head of environment and mobility at City Hall, the PP\u2019s Borja Carabante, announced the plan during a visit to the Casa de Campo, a sprawling public park west of the city that is one of the areas most affected by the bird species.\nThe plan is set to be carried out in the fall of next year, and will cost between \u20ac6 and \u20ac8 for each parakeet, around \u20ac100,000 in total.\nThe population of monk parakeets in Madrid has increased 33% since 2016. The small, bright-green birds, which are also known as the Quaker parrot, can live up to 20 years in captivity and reproduce rapidly, producing six to eight eggs a year. As well as making unpleasant screeching noises, the monk parakeets transmit diseases to other birds, consume their food and push out other species, explains Santiago Soria Carreras, the head of the Biodiversity Service at Madrid City Hall. According to Soria Carreras, falling nests have not caused any damage to passers-by yet, although the previous local government received 197 complaints about the birds from residents between January and August of this year.\nMadrid City Hall received 197 complaints about the birds between January and August of this year\n\u201cIt is an animal that adapts very well to conditions that are not its own. It has adapted because it is very intelligent. It also eats many things and takes advantage of any scrap of food or vegetable,\u201d said Soria Carreras. The cold has not had any effect on the parakeets because their nests are very thick, even though the bird comes from the warm climate of the semi-tropical rainforest north of Argentina and south of Brazil. These nests can weigh up to 200 kilos, although they are usually between 40 and 50 kilos. \u201cIf [the nests] are made at a height of 15 to 20 meters, [the impact when they fall] is completely lethal,\u201d added Carabante.\nCarabante says the plan will be carried out in accordance with the animal welfare law, but it has yet to be finalized. The environmental head explained that not all of the monk parakeets in Madrid will be culled, as stipulated by the law, but says that a population of up to 600 birds \u201cwould cause minimal or acceptable\u201d damage.\nAccording to a census conducted by Madrid City Hall, the areas most affected by the monk parakeets are Carabanchel (with around 2,300 birds, 20% of the total population in the capital) and Moncloa-Aravaca.\u201cWe don\u2019t know why they concentrate in certain zones because their behavior in the urban environment is unknown, but the population is increasing and they could move districts,\u201d said Soria Carreras.\nIn 2005, a thousand monk parakeets were documented in Madrid, which was considered \u201cproblematic because the population from this figure does not decrease by itself,\u201d explained Soria Carreras, who added that the invasive species is also affecting other Spanish cities such as Barcelona, M\u00e1laga and Valencia.\nThe invasion of the monk parakeet dates back to the 1980s and 1990s, when the birds were sold as pets. In 2011, the Agriculture\u00a0Ministry included the bird on the list of exotic tropical species, but to date, around 200,000 parakeets have arrived in Spain. \u201cThey end up in parks because the owners get tired of them and set them free, or the birds escape,\u201d explained Soria Carreras.\n\u201cAll animal control hurts, and I\u2019m the first to be hurt, but we have to understand that it is for the greater good, which is protecting the flora and fauna of Guadarrama [national park], the species that should be there,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what could happen if we don\u2019t manage to reduce the population. But it\u2019s certain that they will push out our fauna and the possibility of a nest causing a serious accident would be greater.\u201d\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/08/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
