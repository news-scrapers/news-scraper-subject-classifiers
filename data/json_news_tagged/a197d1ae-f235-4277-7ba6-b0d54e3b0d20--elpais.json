A group of half-a-dozen youths pounces on a tourist in an attempt to steal his watch on the seafront promenade in Joan de Borb\u00f3. A plain-clothes officer from the Catalan regional police force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, gets on the scene in time to apprehend one of them. The youngster resists arrest, and the two, thief and policeman, end up with bruises. The tourist is taken to hospital, likely with a broken hand. The police manage to get the watch back, although it is broken. The rest of the gang disappears from the scene, including the actual thief himself.\nThis is the kind of crime that the Mossos are trying to combat in Barcelona. \u201cIt\u2019s a new paradigm,\u201d explain police sources. \u201cThey\u2019re packs of youngsters that go out to hunt.\u201d The same sources blame these gangs for the rise in violent crimes committed in the center of Barcelona \u2013 around 40 a day, between those seen in the streets, in establishments and muggings \u2013 that has been detected in recent months. \u201cIt\u2019s their way of life,\u201d they add.\nFrom a group of eight, you can catch three of them, but they might not even be the actual thieves\nCatalan police sources\nIn May, the Catalan police established a specific team \u2013 called Poli\u00e9drico, meaning \u201cmultifaceted\u201d \u2013 that is dedicated to monitoring the steps of these youngsters, most of whom are unaccompanied migrants under the age of 18, and others who are adults. Analysis of their work has produced a \u201ctop 22\u201d list of youngsters who have an average of 15 arrests or complaints against them, according to data presented at the last Local Security Committee in Barcelona. Some of these youngsters have been arrested more than 30 times.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to take action against them,\u201d explain police sources. The usual parameters applied to catch thieves who plan their jobs, or pickpockets who operate to avoid violence, cannot be used here. They swarm through the center of the city, and when the want to, they steal together. \u201cFrom a group of eight, you can catch three of them, but they might not even be the actual thieves, nor can you get back what they\u2019ve stolen,\u201d the same sources explain. This complicates gathering evidence against them and means that it is hard to have them locked up in pre-trial custody. Just 10% of those arrested for violent robberies this year have been held in custody \u2013 165 of 1,529 detainees up to August 14.\nThe current wave of violent street robberies is creating a sense of insecurity in Barcelona, but they account for just 3.6% off all offenses, coming in at 115,014 in the year up to June, 9% up on last year\u2019s figures. The majority of registered crimes in the Catalan capital are thefts, accounting for half of the total and coming in at around 365 a day on average. Violent robberies in people\u2019s homes, meanwhile, have fallen by 16%.\nBarcelona has a problem and it can\u2019t be covered up\nJosep Cid, coordinator of Criminology studies at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB)\n\u201cBarcelona has a problem and it can\u2019t be covered up,\u201d explains Josep Cid, coordinator of Criminology studies at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). But he believes that the rest of Spain is also seeing a small rise in crime, with an 8.5% increase in violent robberies in the year up to March, according to the latest figures available from the Interior Ministry. Sexual violence is also on the rise, although experts attribute this to increased social awareness and a greater likelihood of victims reporting such offenses.\nWhatever the case, Barcelona is at the top of the list for worsening crime statistics, with a 17% rise in registered offenses in 2018. Cid has no doubt that this is partly due to the \u201cdeterioration of living conditions\u201d in the Raval neighborhood, in the center of the city \u2013 its district, Ciutat Vella, is where half of all thefts and violent robberies take place. \u201cWe need to make policies to avoid this, and fight so that the degradation doesn\u2019t get worse and locals get involved,\u201d he adds. He also warns of the risk of \u201ccrime being seen as an opportunity in the neighborhood.\u201d\nDiego Torrent, a doctor in Sociology at the University of Barcelona, argues that there is \u201cno other alternative criminal phenomenon that has changed so much to explain the figures\u201d in the Catalan capital than the arrival of migrant minors, with a care system that is \u201coverwhelmed\u201d and trying to \u201cpalliate exclusion.\u201d The majority of these migrants do not commit offenses, according to data from the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, but those who do are highly likely to reoffend.\nAnd why has this phenomenon not been seen in other cities that have also taken in these minors? Torrente points to the \u201cenvironmental and social disorders that overlap\u201d in Barcelona, such as the high rates of tourism and street hawking, which \u201chave created a less-cohesive environment, weakening informal social controls.\u201d\nCrime rates in Madrid and Barcelona have grown in the first quarter of the year, according to data from the Interior Ministry, rising 7.6% and 12%, respectively. With differing populations, areas and pressure from tourists, both regional capitals have identical homicide rates according to the data \u2013 0.6 for every 100,000 inhabitants. This figure is within the Spanish average, which is one of the lowest in Europe. The big difference in the statistics is when it comes to violent robberies, with 312.9 for every 100,000 inhabitants in Madrid, compared to 757.6 in Barcelona. Experts point to tourism as one of the factors behind this, given that 30 million visitors spend just a day or more than one night in the Catalan capital every year. Some 22% of the victims of all of the offenses in the city are tourists, police sources explain. In both cities, minor thefts account for nearly half of all offenses committed on the streets.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/26/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
