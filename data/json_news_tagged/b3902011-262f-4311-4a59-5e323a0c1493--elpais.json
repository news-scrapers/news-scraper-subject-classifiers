But when the current mayor of Madrid, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida from the right-wing Popular Party (PP), took office in June, he decided to suspend fines for violating drivers.\nThis decision was overturned four days later by a Madrid court that ruled that Madrid Central was needed to stop pollution from rising \u201cwithout any kind of control.\u201d The suspension was blocked in another two court rulings, and on August 29, Almeida announced he would not be appealing the decision.\nBut while fines were suspended for just a few days, Ecologists in Action argue the confusion over the local government\u2019s position on Madrid Central has led to a rise in pollution.\n\u201cThe effectiveness of Madrid Central fell in the past two months, coinciding with a change from a very clear situation, with fines, to a City Hall that came into office saying it wanted to get rid of Madrid Central. This has generated a situation of uncertainty,\u201d said Juan B\u00e1rcena, from Ecologists in Action.\nThe air pollution monitoring network, which has 24 stations across the Spanish capital, measures the level of air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide. The records vary according to the weather conditions (pollution is worse if there is no rain) and the intensity of traffic (more cars, more pollution).\nIn January, the Plaza del Carmen monitoring station recorded an average of 55 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per cubic meter of air \u2013 far above the 40 micrograms considered harmful by the World Health Organization. But when the Madrid Central fines were rolled out in April, that monthly figure dropped to 22 micrograms \u2013 five points below the network average. The following month, air pollution in Madrid dropped to \u201chistoric lows,\u201d according to Ecologists in Action.\nThe effectiveness of Madrid Central fell in the past two months\nEcologists in Action\nBut this downward trend was reversed after Almeida tried to suspend Madrid Central. Nitrogen oxide levels in the center of the city were up to 35 micrograms in July, and to 33 micrograms in August.\n\u201cThe Plaza del Carmen monitoring station went from being one of the stations with the lowest levels of nitrogen dioxide of all the network, to one of the worst in the last two months,\u201d according to the report.\nAlmeida has called on the environmental group to \u201ckeep debate outside of political inclination.\u201d After campaigning to get rid of Madrid Central, the coalition government between the PP and Ciudadanos, which took power thanks to the support of the far-right Vox, now boasts about how many drivers it has fined for violating the anti-pollution plan.\nFines for entering Madrid Central without authorization soared from 13,361 in May \u2013 when municipal elections were held \u2013 to 79,908 in June, according to local registers. That is a sixfold rise, which Almeida said is proof that his predecessor Manuela Carmena \u201cand her team did not believe in Madrid Central.\u201d\nIn September, Almeida is expected to announce a new plan to combat air pollution, but has not provided any details yet on what it may involve.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/16/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
