It is what Ousmane Tehior, 49, is preparing for breakfast. A seasoned sailor, he has been fishing since he was a child in Senegal.\nOn the bridge of the Bona Mar 2, Carlos Mart\u00edn, the boat\u2019s captain, shines a light on a piece of trash they have pulled from the sea \u2013 the chassis of a Seat 750, which was on the market 60 years ago. Mart\u00edn also has a salvaged 1956 calendar in his house.\nIn one haul, the fishermen pick up plastic bottles, sanitary wipes and condom packets\nThe sea is awash with garbage, including stuff that was ditched centuries ago, such as the broken amphora that now decorates the Bona Mar 2. But most of the debris is not that special. In fact, it really is trash. The metropolitan area of Barcelona is the second-biggest culprit when it comes to emptying plastic waste into the Mediterranean, according to a 2019 report from the World Wildlife Fund, trumped only by \u00c7ukurova in the southern coast of Turkey.\nResearchers from the Institute of Marine Sciences (ICM-CSIC) concluded in another report that between Barcelona and Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, trash accounts for 38% of a fisherman\u2019s catch. They also analyzed the amount of residue in the Ebro river delta and found that a mere 5% was litter. Moreover, Mart\u00edn and Llu\u00eds Tall\u00f3, the owner of Bona Mar 2, don\u2019t think that 38% is a particularly accurate figure; they would put it lower.\nThe Fishermen\u2019s Association of Barcelona, which comprises around a dozen boats, agreed in 2015 to take the trash they fished from the sea back to port. EL PA\u00cdS went aboard the Bona Mar 2 on September 20 and witnessed the vessel return to shore with 350 kilograms of fish and 20 kilograms of trash. This, in fact, was not all the debris that was caught in their nets, but the smaller pieces go back into the water along with the seaweed and sediment. \u201cEven after a heavy storm, we pick up 30 kilograms at the most, including everything that comes down the Bes\u00f2s and Llobregat rivers,\u201d says Mart\u00edn. \u201cIt\u2019s not even 10% of our catch.\u201d\nThis problem can be solved with education\nCarlos Mart\u00edn, captain of \u2018Bono Mar 2\u2019\nMart\u00edn\u2019s assessment coincides with other scientific data; namely that most of the litter is land-based \u2013 80% of it, according to the European Commission \u2013 and that the rivers Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s are the main highways that carry it out to sea. The ICM-CSIC report insists it is affecting the fishing industry, reducing the catch and wasting fishermen\u2019s time as they are forced to clean and repair their nets.\nMart\u00edn, who has been trawling the ocean for the past 30 years, says that nowadays less trash comes out of the water, though in the past four years there has been a rash of disposal wipes made from cellulose. \u201cThey are a headache,\u201d he says. \u201cThey get caught in the nets and it\u2019s really difficult to get them off.\u201d\nThe nets are first emptied six miles off the coast of Sitges, after almost two hours of trawling. The maneuver is repeated three times over 12 hours: the first one produces the least trash, being at the furthest point from Barcelona, explains Mart\u00edn.\nAboard the Bona Mar 2, the nets\u2019 contents reveal a mass of mud, squid, fish, starfish and objects such as industrial sealing tape and disposable wipes in a tangle of seaweed. The second haul is done opposite Barcelona\u2019s El Prat airport, where the horizon is lined with merchant and cruise ships \u2013 also a significant source of debris. This time, copious amounts of plastic bottles, sanitary napkins and condom packets nestle alongside the monkfish.\nThe metropolitan area of Barcelona is the second-biggest culprit when it comes to emptying plastic waste into the Mediterranean\nBrands from the 1970s are fished out too, such as a Danone yogurt pot from 1977 and a small Lafich shampoo container with a price tag of six pesetas, the Spanish currency before the euro was adopted. There are also objects from cruise ships, such as a plastic ashtray with the Grimaldi Group logo and beauty products by a brand from Genoa.\nWhen the nets are pulled up for the last time, between the the Llobregat and the Bes\u00f2s river deltas, debris from 90 meters down is dredged up. There are shoe soles, sunflower seed and potato chip bags, a beer can, a Mistol bottle of detergent from the 1970s, a Playmobil toy, more disposable wipes and a number of glass bottles. \u201cWe can watch the evolution of brands from the boat,\u201d says Jordi Tom\u00e1s Hierro, Bona Mar 2\u2019s helmsman. \u201cWe are seeing fewer and fewer bags from [former superstore] Pryca and Coca-Cola glass bottles. There was a load of them before.\u201d\nMart\u00edn and Tall\u00f3 insist that from where they are standing, there is evidence that trash is being more efficiently disposed of these days. \u201cPeople are increasingly aware,\u201d says Mart\u00edn, recalling his childhood days when he had to cross a floating carpet of garbage before they could swim in the sea at Barceloneta beach. \u201cThis problem can be solved with education.\u201d\nNot all sea debris is easily identified. Scientists from Barcelona University detected an average of 100,000 microplastics \u2013 less than 5mm in diameter \u2013 per square kilometer along the Mediterranean coast. The report warns that plastic is ingested by marine life, including plankton, and that 65% of the microplastics that have been detected are composed of polyethylene.\nResearch from the Institute of Marine Sciences adds another hidden pollutant that makes up 28% of the trash along the Catalan coast: clinker, the residue from coal furnaces used to fuel ships during 150 years.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/03/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
