Michael O\u2019Sullivan emigrated to London in the 1930s to finish his medical studies and ended up marrying an English nurse, Norah, which kept him in the UK where he had seven children, went to Mass every Sunday and died of a heart attack in 1964, seven years before Emma was born.\nAfter many months of red tape, compiling documents and gathering certified copies, Emma has been able to officially declare herself a citizen of the Republic of Ireland, despite the fact that she has never set foot on Irish soil and still hasn\u2019t got her passport.\n\u201cWhen I get my new passport, I should fly to Cork and kiss the ground like the Pope,\u201d she jokes.\nAnother seven of the 15 O\u2019Sullivan cousins have applied for Irish nationality. For most, it amounts to a political gesture rather than a necessity, but the fact that October 31 \u2013 the date earmarked for Britain to leave the EU \u2013 is looming makes it unlikely they\u2019ll get it prior to Brexit.\nThe fact I have never had to think of my nationality before is proof of my white western privilege\nEmma O\u2019Sullivan\nBefore the referendum, Ireland\u2019s Foreign Affairs Department was dealing with around 6,000 applications for citizenship a year. But in 2018 alone, it received 25,000. Irish civil servants involved in processing them have been snowed under, just one of the Brexit-related problems likely to be faced in a country where, after the third pint, the subject of Britain\u2019s \u201c800 years of oppression\u201d tends to crop up.\nIreland and Great Britain both allow dual nationality, which is not the case in all EU countries. \u201cI imagine that if I had had to drop my British nationality, I would have done so for practical reasons, but it would have meant more than a procedure,\u201d says Emma, who has lived in Barcelona since 2006 and has no plans to leave.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a nationalist,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut this process has made me understand that there are certain things that are intangible. Basically, the fact I have never had to think about my nationality before is proof of my white western privilege. I\u2019m not exactly fleeing from conflict with my belongings in a suitcase.\u201d\nIn the process of becoming Irish, she has learned a number of things about her family as well. For example, she had an Irish great-aunt, Michael\u2019s sister, who was so fiercely anti-British that she sympathized with the Nazis during World War II and went to live voluntarily in occupied France. This woman would undoubtedly find it extraordinary that 70 years later, eight of her very English great nephews and nieces are trying to become Irish.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway", "date": "10/21/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
