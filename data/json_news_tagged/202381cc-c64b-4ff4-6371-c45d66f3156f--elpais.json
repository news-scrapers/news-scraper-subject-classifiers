But Conte has come up against his own interior minister, Matteo Salvini of the right-wing League, who continues to refuse the ship entry.\nThe refusal comes despite the fact that six European countries, including Spain, have offered to take in the migrants who were rescued from the central Mediterranean two weeks ago. Although Salvini reluctantly allowed 27 unaccompanied migrants from the ship to dock at the Italian island of Lampedusa on Saturday, 107 remain on board after 18 days at sea.\nThose who remain on the ship are struggling with high levels of stress and anxiety. Over the past 18 days, the deteriorating conditions have led to panic attacks, fights and even suicide attempts. On Saturday, the Open Arms crew warned that the situation was out of control, and they could no longer guarantee the safety of the 107 remaining migrants.\nThe following morning on Sunday, four migrants jumped into the sea and tried to swim to the Italian island of Lampedusa, located less than a kilometer away. Members of the rescue crew swam after them and were able to return them to the boat. But once back on board, a fight broke out between them and the other migrants, which the crew struggled to break up.\nAfter the incident, Proactiva Open Arms sent the port of Lampedusa an urgent request to dock, together with an account of what had happened in the morning, and a report signed by psychologist Alessandro di Benedetti of the NGO Emergency, which argued the migrants were suffering from \u201cextreme vulnerability, both physical and psychological, made worse by the uncertainty and level of stress on the ship.\u201d\nDespu\u00e9s de 26 d\u00edas de misi\u00f3n, 17 de espera con 134 personas a bordo, una resoluci\u00f3n judicial a favor y 6 pa\u00edses dispuestos acoger, \u00bfquiere que naveguemos 950 millas, unos 5 d\u00edas m\u00e1s, a Algeciras, el puerto m\u00e1s lejano del Mediterraneo, con una situaci\u00f3n insostenible a bordo? pic.twitter.com/0wTh16VZhj\n\u201cAfter a 26-day mission, 17 days waiting with 134 people on board, a judicial resolution in our favor and six countries willing to take in [the migrants], they want us to sail 900 miles, five days more, to Algeciras, the most distant port in the Mediterranean?\u201d\nOn Sunday, Spain\u2019s acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, of the Socialist Party (PSOE), offered the Open Arms the southern port of Algeciras in C\u00e1diz, and Mah\u00f3n in Menorca in the Balearic Islands. But Proactiva Open Arms refused the offer, arguing it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to attempt the four- to six-day journey given the conditions on board: \u201cWe cannot endanger the security and physical integrity of the migrants and crew. We need to dock now.\u201d\nThe Open Arms is insisting that it needs to dock in the Italian island of Lampedusa, which is just 800 meters away from its current location. Spain\u2019s acting Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo says the government has been left confused by the decision. \u201cWe have offered all types of support: medical attention, supplies [...] We do not understand the position of\u00a0Open Arms,\u201d she said in an interview on the Cadena SER radio network. \u201cWe understand the situation is critical because of the uncertainty and desperation, but once you tell them they have a safe port, the migrants know they are going to arrive, and anybody can understand that there is no problem,\u201d she added.\nAccording to sources from the NGO, the ship is not equipped to hold so many people on board for such a long period. The 107 rescued migrants and 19 crew members must share the limited space on deck, take turns in the shade and have just two bathrooms.\n\u201cNot even a detainee could be treated this way and here they have us held hostage against our will,\u201d said \u00d2scar Camps, the founder of Proactiva Open Arms.\nMeanwhile, Salvini has celebrated the situation as a victory for the country: \u201cItaly has stopped being Europe\u2019s refugee camp.\u201d\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/19/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
