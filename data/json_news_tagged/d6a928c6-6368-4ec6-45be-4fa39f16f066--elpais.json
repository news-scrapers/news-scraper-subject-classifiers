It was also getting hot inside the narrow two-story home. Dee, the mother, decided to get some fresh air in the park across the street. At first she and her child sat down on the sand under the slide, making the most of a little square of shade.\nThen, in a quick gesture, the 11-month-old child removed his pacifier, picked up a blue substance that was on the ground, and put it in his mouth. It was ecstasy, a synthetic drug. The medical report described its specifically as methylenedioxy-methamphetamine, commonly known as MDMA.\nDee claims that when you are a Romanian living in Spain, not only must you be a decent person, you also have to prove you are one\nEver since the incident, which took place on August 24 in Perales del R\u00edo, an isolated neighborhood of Getafe, south of Madrid, the child\u2019s parents have felt under suspicion. The hospital\u2019s social services have investigated the family members. So did the police, which has sent the case to a court that will now decide whether or not to shelve it.\nDee, who sell cars online, and her partner Marian, a meat haulier who works for Madrid\u2019s biggest wholesale market, Mercamadrid, are now very worried that the system could take away custody of their baby. Dee claims that when you are a Romanian living in Spain, not only must you be a decent person, you also have to prove you are one, especially after what happened to them.\nDee remembers that day with horror. When she realized that the child had something in his mouth, she put her fingers in and saw a trail of blue saliva. She returned home, where her husband was uploading car listings to websites. She, in the meantime, called the emergency services to ask what to do if her baby had eaten chalk, which is what she thought he had swallowed.\nThe parents were described as: \u201cMother: healthy, Romanian origin. Father: healthy, Romanian origin\u201d\nHer husband picked up the child and said: \u201cCan you see how the boy is?\u201d He was stiff. They rushed him to the nearest hospital, and stopped in front of the emergency room. Hospital staff administered intravenous medication, and tests confirmed intoxication with ecstasy. He remained in hospital for three days under observation, then was discharged with no adverse aftereffects.\nThe doctors also noted that the baby had received his mandatory vaccinations. \u201cThere are no signs of social exclusion, this is a healthy child whose health is being adequately seen to. The situation has been explained to the social worker team,\u201d reads a hospital document.\nBut the discharge papers also talked about \u201csocial risk.\u201d The parents were alarmed at that, and did not like the fact that they themselves were described as: \u201cMother: healthy, Romanian origin. Father: healthy, Romanian origin.\u201d\nDee asked a doctor why they were underscoring the fact that they are immigrants. She was told that this is protocol.\nAs soon as they left the hospital, they went to the Getafe police station to file a complaint. Dee says that she found a hostile attitude. \u201cAnd who do you want to file the complaint against, ma\u2019am?\u201d an officer asked her. \u201cThere is no guilty party.\u201d She got angry and replied: \u201cThere is, whoever threw that drug down there, they\u2019re the guilty ones, but that\u2019s your job. I\u2019m not going to bring you the suspect on a platter.\u201d\nA police officer was taking notes. When they were asked to sign the statement, the couple found discrepancies between what they\u2019d said and what was in the document, including the claim that she\u2019d \u201ccome running\u201d when she saw the child putting something in his mouth, when in fact she\u2019d been with him the entire time. Dee thought that one inaccurate word and the social services might accuse her of being a bad mother and take away her child.\nAt this point, she felt that her family\u2019s future was at stake, in a language that was not hers. Besides feeling bad about her son\u2019s experience, she now felt she had to defend herself, as though she were the suspect.\nDee shared her experience on a neighborhood group on Facebook, to alert other people about the risk. Many parents thanked her, but others seemed skeptical. One user even asked her to upload the hospital and police documents to prove her claim. Dee felt increasingly scrutinized by everyone.\nThe father made a video of the park to show the poor state it was in, with the ground covered with cigarette butts, bottle caps and leftover paper for rolling cigarettes. Several years earlier, when Marian and Dee had no children, they had often complained about a group of kids that would spend the night in the park. They were noisy, and Marian has to get up at 4am to go to work. Another neighbor says that those youths would sometimes bury packs of cigarettes that they did not want to bring into their own homes.\nAfter trying to have kids for a long time, Dee finally got pregnant nearly two years ago. She says that the baby has given new meaning to their lives, and that they wouldn\u2019t do anything to put him at risk. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad, but the main thing is that he is all right,\u201d she says.\nDee and Marian are collecting signatures from neighbors in case officials show up at their door one day to take their child away\nAfter the police statement, they were visited by family officers who questioned them and left without giving them any explanations. They wondered why they themselves had not been tested for drugs, to prove that they were not addicts. They tried to get tested at a public hospital, but were given an appointment for two weeks down the line. So they resorted to a private health center, La Zarzuela, where they spent \u20ac500 on the tests.\nThe urine tests came out negative for the 10 most common drugs that are looked for, including the components of ecstasy. The couple took the results, and left them in an envelope at the police station, to be added to their case.\nWhile a judge decides whether or not to proceed with the case, Dee and Marian have turned to their neighbors for support, and have found it. They are collecting signatures in case officials show up at their door one day to take their child away. They will not rest easy until the shadow of suspicion has cleared.\nAfter finding out about the case, the city of Getafe sent out a street cleaner to the site, who spent several hours collecting trash in the park, said a municipal spokeswoman. Days after that, Dee and Marian conducted their own inspection, and found more remains of a blue substance similar to the one that their son had swallowed. The family alerted the authorities, who came back with the forensic police. Officers brought along trained dogs that found a trail, but no physical object that could be taken back to the lab for testing.\nSlowly, families have been returning to the park with their children. They would like nothing better than to leave behind an incident worthy of a crime show such as CSI and go back to the normal routine of the playground swings.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/09/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
