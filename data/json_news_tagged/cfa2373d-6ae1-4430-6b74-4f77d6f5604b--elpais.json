The parents of Hugo, an 11-month-old baby with chronic illness, were granted their wish for him to see the sea. Fabri, a terminally sick boy who wanted to return to his home country of Ecuador and die surrounded by his family, was able to overcome the logistical challenges involved with being transferred while hooked up to machines and medication.\nI am very happy, very. If I drown in the water, I wouldn\u2019t mind\nSergio Romero, who suffers from degenerative polyneuropathy\nAll this was made possible thanks to Ambulancia del Deseo (or Ambulance of Wishes), an initiative organized by a group of health workers from Murcia, in southeastern Spain, aimed at fulfilling the dreams of mobility-impaired and dying patients. The project was inspired by Kees Veldboer, a Dutch ambulance driver who in 2007 agreed to take retired seaman Mario Stefanutto to Rotterdam harbor. After making a few calls and borrowing an ambulance, Veldboer was able to make Stefanutto happy for a few hours and fulfill his dying wish to say goodbye to the port. Two months later, Veldboer created the Stichting Ambulance Wens foundation. The Murcia health workers brought the founder to a conference in 2018. \u201cWe liked his initiative so much we decided to do the same thing here,\u201d they explain.\nThe Ambulance of Wishes has now been operating for a little more than a year. \u201cThe wishes are a way of giving back, and people are very keen to take part,\u201d explained Laura Juguera and Carolina C\u00e1novas, founders of the project, as they helped make another wish come true at the end of August. The volunteers were helping Sergio Romero, a 36-year-old man with degenerative polyneuropathy who wanted to bathe in the sea at Mazarr\u00f3n Bay. \u201cI am whiter than Snow White,\u201d he joked, as he was brought into the water.\nThe last time that Romero had set foot on the coast was five years ago, when his daughter was born and before falling ill. He had already lost his hearing when he was seven years old, and 25 years later he was diagnosed with a rare degenerative disease that has affected his vision, his ability to speak (he had a tracheotomy to make it easier to breathe), and left him paralyzed from the arms down. \u201cIt is a degenerative disease and he got a full-blown version,\u201d says his wife, Lourdes Garcia.\nThe Ambulance of Wishes team picked up Romero from his house, and after an hour\u2019s drive they arrived at the seaside promenade of Mazarr\u00f3n Bay, where his family were waiting for him on the beach with food and drinks. Everyone wanted the day to be special, one they would remember with a smile. Romero may have difficulty talking, hearing and seeing, but his family can communicate by making signs and talking close to his face.\n\u201cIt smells of the sea,\u201d said Romero, with his sunglasses on and covered in sunscreen, as soon as he was taken out of the ambulance. \u201cI am very happy, very. If I drown in the water, I wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d he joked. Romero is an optimistic and decisive person. He loves soccer and watching TV shows such as Breaking Bad, The Wire and Game of Thrones. He is also completing a dual degree in documentation science and journalism.\n\u201cI was very excited when I went into the water and cried like a little boy,\u201d said Romero with the help of his interpreter, Jos\u00e9 Manuel. \u201cI can\u2019t walk, but if I could I would go somewhere I\u2019ve never been.\u201d According to Romero, he can \u201csee\u201d better since his illness stripped him of his sight. \u201cI have more courage now than before, and I feel liberated,\u201d he said, encouraging other sick people not to give up.\nThe Ambulance of Wishes has very few conditions when it comes to granting wishes. Anyone can ask for a wish via their website, as long as it is for emotional reasons, and the person in question cannot move on their own and needs an ambulance. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Salas, an emergency room doctor and another of the organization\u2019s founders, says that granting wishes creates very special and emotional moments. \u201cYou have to accompany them and know how to listen, not just be standing there,\u201d he explains.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/11/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
