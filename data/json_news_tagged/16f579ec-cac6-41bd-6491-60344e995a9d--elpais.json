The closure of the three bases could lead to the loss of 350 cabin crew jobs and 150 pilots, according to the USO.\nThe cabin crew unions criticized the airline for its uncooperative attitude at Tuesday\u2019s meeting, arguing Ryanair representatives arrived an hour late and refused to sit down with the union leaders, meeting only with the mediators.\nOnce the failure of the negotiations is confirmed, the unions will formally announce the strike, which will take place every Friday and Sunday of September, with the exception of the first two days which fall on a Sunday and a Monday. Ryanair has not yet announced whether flights on these dates will be canceled.\nThe mediators are insisting that union leaders and the airline meet again next week, and have asked Ryanair to share the information it has on the planned closures.\n\u201cWe are open to meeting as long as they call us,\u201d confirmed USO leader Jairo Gonzalo, who called on the airline to \u201cproduce the data, and if they really want to close the bases, to begin the proceedings available to the company, so that we can see if these legal instruments apply in this case.\u201d\nThe Ryanair pilot union Sepla will find out on Wednesday whether its members have voted to strike.\nIberia ground handling staff at the Barcelona-El Prat airport will also strike on August 24, 25, 30 and 31, after mediation with the airline ended without an agreement.\nThe UGT union has also called a work stoppage of Iberia ground staff at Madrid-Barajas airport for August 30 and 31 to demand a new employment plan that will improve contract conditions, and redistribute the number of hours in a working year so that staff are in the airport work centers and cargo terminal for fewer days.\nThe UGT has also announced that ground staff at the Iberia Airport Service at Bilbao Airport, in the Basque Country, are planning to hold two 24-hour strikes on yet-to-be-confirmed dates. The planned work stoppage comes after last week\u2019s partial strikes to protest for better working conditions.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/21/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
