Four of the members are currently serving 15-year-prison terms, while Antonio Manuel Guerrero is serving an additional two years for stealing the victim\u2019s cellphone.\nIn Wednesday\u2019s ruling, which can be appealed, the judges sentenced the defendants to the maximum sentence requested by both the private prosecution, brought by the victim, and the public accusation, brought by the regional government of Navarre and the city of Pamplona. Both were also ordered to pay \u20ac5,670 in damages.\nThe three judges agreed that the videos and photographs were taken \u201cwith the idea of capturing and recording the acts of a sexual nature\u201d committed against the victim, and without her \u201cexpressed or tacit consent.\u201d\nThe judges acquitted three of the other La Manada members of committing privacy offenses.The lawyer for La Manada, Agust\u00edn Mart\u00ednez Becerra, told EL PA\u00cdS that they would appeal the sentence.\nFour members of La Manada also stood trial this week over accusations they sexually abused an unconscious 21-year-old woman in Pozoblanco, in the southern province of C\u00f3rdoba, just two months before the gang rape in Pamplona.\nIn this separate case, they are accused of kissing and touching the breasts of the woman in a moving vehicle while she was asleep, also capturing their actions on a cellphone and then sharing the recordings via WhatsApp.\nThe recording came to light during the investigative phase of the Pamplona case, after the judge in charge of the probe alerted a colleague in Pozoblanco, in the Andalusian province of C\u00f3rdoba, about the images that were discovered on the cellphones of the gang.\nThe video is the main evidence to support the accusation against the defendants.\nThe judge in charge of the case confirmed in a written statement that the accused and the victim met on May 1 in local fiestas in Torrecampo, also in C\u00f3rdoba. The young woman decided to return to Pozoblanco with the members of La Manada, and got into a vehicle belonging to Guerrero, who is a member of Spain\u2019s Civil Guard. According to the judge\u2019s findings, the girl sat \u201cin the middle of the back seat, between Alfonso Jes\u00fas,\u201d who is a member of the military, \u201cand Jes\u00fas,\u201d who is a hairdresser.\nAs soon as she got into the car, the woman \u201cfell into a deep state of unconsciousness, a state that the suspects took advantage of to touch her breasts.\u201d Cabezuelo then \u201cgrabs her by the neck and gives her a number of kisses on her mouth,\u201d while Prenda records everything with Guerrero\u2019s cellphone, \u201cat the same time touching her breasts.\u201d Escudero and Cabezuelo continue to touch the victim\u2019s breasts, until the civil guard does the same, \u201cwhile driving.\u201d\nBut the harassment did not stop there, according to the investigating judge. Once in Pozoblanco, Cabezuelo and the victim moved into the front seats, while the other men left the vehicle. Just before arriving at her home, the young woman woke up, \u201cwhich is when Alfonso orders her to fellate him, and, given her refusal, he slaps her in the face and on the arm, throwing her out of the car, while calling her a \u2018whore\u2019.\u201d Cabezuelo is facing a separate assault charge for having struck the victim.\nOn the first court hearing on Monday, the defendants declared they were innocent, and invoked their right not to answer questions from either the defense or prosecutors. The public prosecutor is calling for each of the four men to be sentenced to three years for sexual abuse and four years for privacy offenses.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/20/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
