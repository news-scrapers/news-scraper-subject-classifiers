The word is often used negatively by far-right parties such as Vox, which want to portray these minors as foreign delinquents who should go back to their countries of origin.\nThere is no such thing as illegal people. Their actions, if anything, can be illegal\nFrancisco Javier Garc\u00eda Casta\u00f1o, Granada University\nExperts in immigration and children\u2019s issues say that using this word hides the fact that these are children and teenagers who have arrived in Spain without their families, and who are living in vulnerable conditions.\nSeveral politicians and associations have already criticized the use of the word \u201cmena\u201d instead of simply \u201cminor.\u201d Teresa Rodr\u00edguez, secretary general of the anti-austerity party Podemos in Andalusia, said on Twitter that the use of the word dehumanizes children and teens.\nLes llaman \"MENAS\" porque quieren que nos olvidemos de que son NI\u00d1OS Y NI\u00d1AS que est\u00e1n SOLOS.No caigamos en su juego. No dejemos que los deshumanicen. pic.twitter.com/WBODmk0OuV\n\u201cThey call them MENAS because they want us to forget that they are BOYS and GIRLS who are ALONE. Let's not fall in their game. Let's not let them be dehumanized.\u201d\nThe United Nation\u2019s children\u2019s agency UNICEF also launched a campaign a few days before the elections, noting that the majority of migrant children \u201chave committed no crimes.\u201d And the NGO Save the Children has criticized \u201cthe rhetoric of hate and the criminalization of migrant children,\u201d urging authorities to guarantee their safety, especially after cases of attacks against unaccompanied minors in Madrid and Zaragoza.\nAlthough the term was originally neutral and used for years in legislation and immigration studies, \u201cwhen it reaches the wider public and only the acronym is used, we are categorizing [the minors] in such a way as to seem to be talking about something other than children,\u201d says Carmela del Moral, head of children\u2019s policies at Save the Children.\nThe anthropologist Francisco Javier Garc\u00eda Casta\u00f1o, director of the Migration Institute at Granada University, compares it to the use of \u201cillegal\u201d to describe undocumented migrants. \u201cThere is no such thing as illegal people. Their actions, if anything, can be illegal.\u201d\n\n\n// <![CDATA[\n trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(\"TIMESERIES\", {\"comparisonItem\":[{\"keyword\":\"menas\",\"geo\":\"ES\",\"time\":\"today 5-y\"}],\"category\":0,\"property\":\"\"}, {\"exploreQuery\":\"date=today%205-y&geo=ES&q=menas\",\"guestPath\":\"https://trends.google.es:443/trends/embed/\"});\n// ]]>\n\nAn analysis of Google searches shows that until this year, there was barely any online discussion about these unaccompanied minors, and that there was a peak in the summer coinciding with a surge in Barcelona street crime that was attributed to some of these minors. There was another peak during the election campaign in early November.\nAccording to Interior Ministry figures, in July 2019 Spain had taken charge of 12,262 minors. This is more than in December 2017 (6,414), but slightly fewer than in 2018.\nAccording to a Catalan government report on the nearly 3,000 unaccompanied migrant minors living in the region, in March 2019, 91% had no record of police or court proceedings against them.\nMost of these minors come from Morocco and Algeria, and the majority are teenage boys.\nBefore the November 10 election, the acting ombudsman, Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez Marug\u00e1n, issued a statement that did not mention any political party specifically, but criticized the policy of criminalizing a community that he described as \u201cthe most vulnerable of the vulnerable.\u201d\nRoc\u00edo Monasterio, the speaker of the far-right Vox party in the Madrid regional assembly, went twice to migrant minor centers before the election, and described its occupants as \u201cpacks of menas.\u201d One center in the Hortaleza district of Madrid suffered an attempted break-in by a group fo 30 people armed with sticks, stones and bottles. There was a similar incident in Castelldefels, in Barcelona.\nEdelia Villarroya, a psychologist and director of a master\u2019s degree in migration studies at Valencia University, says that using the term helps portray these minors as a threat, and makes it easier to appeal to emotions such as fear and insecurity. \u201cThe problem posed by these minors, from a statistical viewpoint, is insignificant. The weakest link is being used as a scapegoat,\u201d she says.\nThe debate over the use of the term predates the election. In July, the Interior Ministry said it was considering using a different word. The term NNAMNA was suggested (Ni\u00f1os, Ni\u00f1as y Adolescentes Migrantes No Acompa\u00f1ados, or Unaccompanied Migrant Boys, Girls and Teenagers.)\nVillarroya feels that a name change will not be much use, while Garc\u00eda Casta\u00f1o and Del Moral think it might help.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/14/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
