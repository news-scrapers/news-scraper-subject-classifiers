And it\u2019s taken us nearly as long to remove its creator\u2019s remains from a place of public tribute,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez, speaking from La Moncloa, the seat of the Spanish government, just hours after Franco\u2019s casket was transported from the Valley of the Fallen to the cemetery in the north of the Madrid region.\nThe Socialist leader said that having Franco in the Valley of the Fallen, a popular destination for tourists and far-right nostalgics, \u201cwas more than anachronistic and anomalous: it was an affront to Spanish democracy.\u201d\nS\u00e1nchez pledged to carry out Franco\u2019s exhumation when he reached power in early June 2018 on the back of a successful no-confidence vote against then-PM Mariano Rajoy of the Popular Party (PP). But the project ran into 16 months of administrative and legal hurdles as Franco\u2019s family fought the move. In September, the Supreme Court ruled that the exhumation could go ahead.\nIt took us a long time to get rid of a repressive regime. And it\u2019s taken us nearly as long to remove its creator\u2019s remains from a place of public tribute\nCaretaker PM Pedro S\u00e1nchez\nWhile left-leaning parties celebrated the move, right-wing groups have criticized it, claiming it reopens old wounds. The Franco family released a statement saying that the Spanish government had \u201cconsummated the desecration of the tomb of our grandfather Francisco Franco with a serious violation of our fundamental rights.\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s Spain is the result of forgiveness, but it cannot be the result of forgetting,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez on Thursday, addressing the right-wing\u2019s arguments that the past should be left alone. He also alluded to the nearly 34,000 victims of the Civil War (1936-1939) and subsequent dictatorship who lie buried at the Valley of the Fallen, and a third of whom are still unidentified.\n\u201cIt is an infamy that will have to be redressed sooner or later as well. Today\u2019s Spain is indebted to those families,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez, who is facing a repeat national election on November 10 after he failed to form a government following an earlier, inconclusive vote in April.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/24/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
