But seasoned politicians know that campaigns are always marked by uncertainty, and that any last-minute event can alter even the best-laid plans.\nThe Socialist Party (PSOE), for instance, was happy with the outcome of the candidates\u2019 debate on Monday, and expected smooth sailing between then and Sunday. But that was only until Wednesday, when the caretaker Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez made a controversial statement about the judiciary that earned him opprobrium from Spanish prosecutors and forced him to quickly rephrase his remarks.\nS\u00e1nchez, who has struck a noticeably tougher tone on Catalonia in a bid to attract undecided center and right-of-center voters, on Wednesday suggested in a radio interview that Spain\u2019s prosecution services depended on the executive, and that therefore, the government should be credited for any moves aimed at bringing former Catalan premier Carles Puigdemont back to Spain from Belgium to face criminal prosecution over his role in the 2017 failed secession attempt.\nProsecutors were so irritated by the remark that their largest association issued a statement noting that the decision to turn Puigdemont over to Spain in compliance with the European arrest warrant issued by the Supreme Court depends exclusively on the Belgian justice system.\nAnother element of uncertainty is the unstoppable rise of Vox, the far-right party that first entered government in December 2018 with 12 seats in the Andalusian parliament. At the general election of April 28, Vox took 24 seats in Congress, and polls suggest it could nearly double this figure on Sunday.\nUntil recently, it was believed that the mainstream conservative Popular Party (PP) would regain many of the votes that it lost in April, but the Catalan crisis seems to have given wings to the far-right party, which now stands to become the third largest force in the 350-seat lower house. And that has upended everyone else\u2019s campaign plans.\nMiguel Gonz\u00e1lez\nVox has informed the PRISA Group, owner of EL PA\u00cdS, that \u201cfrom now on it will no longer issue accreditations to any journalist with ties to PRISA, either to access its headquarters or to attend any event organized by this political party in private spaces.\u201d\nSources at Vox said this decision is linked to an editorial published by EL PA\u00cdS on Wednesday (available in English here), which warned that the arguments used by party leader Santiago Abascal at the televised debate on Monday, many of which were xenophobic and intolerant in nature, should be setting off alarms in Spain.\nThis is not the first time that Vox has prevented PRISA journalists from accessing its events, but it is the first time it has imposed a blanket ban on them. Several press associations have noted that this violates freedom of information, which is enshrined in the Spanish Constitution.\nUntil now, the only other party that had vetoed the media at its events was Batusuna, the radical far-left party linked to the Basque terrorist organization ETA.\nThe fact that the other candidates refrained from engaging with Vox leader Santiago Abascal at the televised debate on Monday has triggered intense internal debates within the other parties, as they now gauge how much the far-right group\u2019s expected gains will affect their own outcomes.\nAfter ignoring Abascal during the debate, S\u00e1nchez is now refuting the latter\u2019s campaign claims at last-minute rallies where he says that the PSOE is the only party that can guarantee \u201ca courageous government\u201d that will face up to \u201can emboldened far right\u201d because both the PP and Ciudadanos are \u201cnerveless\u201d before Vox.\nMeanwhile, Pablo Iglesias of the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos group is blaming the rise of Vox on \u201cthe economic policies of [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel, [Spanish ex-finance minister Crist\u00f3bal] Montoro and [Spanish acting economy minister Nadia] Calvi\u00f1o.\u201d He also pointed a finger at the media, and proposed fighting the far right with social policies for citizens who feel tempted to vote for Vox.\nIn fact, some veteran left-wing politicians are worried that Spain could suffer from the \u201cFrench effect\u201d: when Marine LePen\u2019s ultranationalist National Front (since rebranded National Rally) started to grow, it not only took votes from France\u2019s right-wing parties, but also from communist and social-democratic constituencies.\nSo far, polls suggest that Spain is not at this stage, but alarms are already ringing about the future, especially considering that the outcome of Sunday\u2019s vote could be as inconclusive as in April, bringing Spain no closer to forming a stable government.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/07/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
