Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Seville and more recently London, Paris, Berlin, Barcelona and Valencia are all becoming cycle-friendly, and pedal power is even being championed in cities where the car is king, such as New York, Bogot\u00e1 and Mexico City.\nGiven this general trend, it is all the more remarkable that Madrid City Council has declared it is planning to remove a bike lane for the benefit of drivers.\n\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s very strange to be seeing cycle paths removed in order to reopen lanes for private vehicles,\u201d says Valeria Fedeli, president of the European Urban Research Association, (EURA). \u201cMost mayors across the world are changing their cities to introduce new ways of getting around.\u201d\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ezquiaga, the president of the Spanish Association of Urban Technicians, agrees. \u201cThe global trend is to reduce the tarmac,\u201d he says. \u201cIn order for cycling to be a viable means of transport, it needs to be simple and safe for everyone, which involves creating a network of bike lanes across the entire city.\u201d\nAccording to the Madrid City Council, which is currently controlled by a center-right alliance of the Popular Party (PP) and Ciudadanos (Citizens), the cycle lane that is going to be removed is just 850 meters long and located on the Gran V\u00eda of Madrid\u2019s Hortaleza district, in the north of the city. Created by the former leftist mayor Manuela Carmena, it is a no-car zone although cars must drive across it to reach a number of designated parking spaces. The authorities have justified its removal by arguing that it is generating congestion in the area. \u201cWe will return all the lanes that don\u2019t help cycling mobility to their original use,\u201d said Mayor Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez Almeida after making the controversial announcement.\nHowever, when queried by EL PA\u00cdS, city officials were unable to explain the exact criteria for the cycle lane reversal. Almeida and his deputy, Bego\u00f1a Villac\u00eds, first got to work removing the pedestrian zone on Galileo street recently created by the previous administration, and returning it to private vehicles. Now, City Hall is studying the removal of at least two additional cycle lanes.\nA city of three million residents, Madrid has just 43 kilometers of lanes reserved for cyclists, some segregated and others defined by lines on the road. Barcelona, which has half the population of the Spanish capital, has a 209-kilometer network. And Seville and Valencia, with populations of 688,000 and 791,000 respectively, have 200 and 150 kilometers\u2019 worth of bike lanes.\nBut the global trend is not just to extend the number of cycle lanes. It is also to improve existing lanes by physically separating them from the rest of the traffic to make them safer. \u201cLondon, Berlin and Paris are trading the lanes that are designated with paint for protected ones,\u201d says David Lois, a lecturer at UNED and researcher at the Transportation Research Center at Madrid Polytechnic University.\nThis week, New York City Council announced a $1.7 billion plan that includes the creation of 400 kilometers of protected bike lanes, prompted by the death of 25 cyclists this year. Many New Yorkers have been vociferous in their rejection of bike lanes in the past, arguing that they reduce parking space and affect retail business; in some cases, the authorities have even been taken to court.\n\u201cMany studies indicate that cycle lanes benefit the local economy,\u201d says Giuseppe Grezzi, the mobility councilor in Valencia. \u201cWe have been criticized but the results have shown us to be right.\u201d\nAccording to Grezzi, in other parts of the world the shift to more sustainable modes of transportation has cut across political persuasions, but in Spain it is viewed as a left-wing policy. He considers the decision in Madrid to be \u201ca step back by the archaic right.\u201d\nEsther Anaya, who is researching bicycle mobility at Imperial College, London, is also very critical of Madrid\u2019s regressive move. \u201cTaking this step back is not only embarrassing, it\u2019s also an attack on people\u2019s health,\u201d she says. \u201cWe either opt for speed and pollution or for giving this space over to bicycles and pedestrians to promote active and healthy mobility.\u201d\nBut it is not enough to just paint the lines of the bike lane on the road. Easier to ignore, lanes of this kind put the lives of cyclists in jeopardy. \u201cWe are against getting rid of cycle lanes in any Spanish city, and support the construction of protected lanes to improve cyclist safety,\u201d says Nacho Tom\u00e1s, secretary of the association Red de Ciudades por la Bicicleta (City Network for Bicycles), which encompasses more than 100 towns and cities across Spain, including Madrid.\n\u201cMadrid is the only city in the world that has thought of getting rid of cycle lanes,\u201dsays Niccolo Panozzo, spokesman for the European Cyclists Federation (ECF). From Portland to Bogot\u00e1 and Singapore to Tel Aviv, every other city is moving in the opposite direction, he adds.\nBarcelona. The Catalan capital has 209 kilometers of cycle lanes, almost all of which are physically separated from motor vehicle traffic, and half of which have been created in the last eight years. \u201cSeveral cycle routes have been improved by changing their location \u2013 either shifting them from the sidewalk to the roadway or making them wider to improve safety,\u201d says mobility councilor Rosa Alarc\u00f3n.\nNew York. The bicycle is central to a two-pronged mobility and sustainability strategy in New York, a city that has long been choked with motor vehicles. During the last 20 years, the network of cycle lanes has gradually expanded and now covers almost 2,000 kilometers. An average of 100 kilometers of cycle lanes a year have been added over the last three years, according to the Department of Transportation. There is also a shared bike scheme known as CitiBike that was launched in 2013.\nParis. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, is keenly pro-bike and next year she aims to start work on 1,000 kilometers of cycle lanes to double the existing number and create a network that will allow people on bikes to feel safe across the city. She is also establishing several pedestrian zones.\nLondon. The UK capital has around 100 kilometers of cycle paths in the city center and others that are marked but shared with cars. However, an ambitious plan is afoot to create 450 kilometers of cycle superhighways by 2020 to link the outskirts with the city center and make sure that 28% of Londoners have a cycle path not further than 400 meters from their home.\nValencia. The city has 156 kilometers of cycle lanes and next week another 2.4 kilometers are being inaugurated in Primado de Reig. Since the five-kilometer cycling ring route was established in 2017, more than three million cyclists have used it.\nBerlin. The German city has around 1,000 kilometers of cycle paths. The mobility law passed last year now stipulates that all the main streets in Berlin must have one.\nAmsterdam. Considered the world capital of cycling, Amsterdam has 767 kilometers of cycle routes and 10,000 parking spots for bikes. A new initiative aims to get rid of 11,200 parking spaces for private vehicles by 2025 in order to make the city more pedestrian-friendly.\nRome. The city has a total of 242 kilometers of cycle paths \u2013 142 along the streets and the rest in parks. Recently, new routes have been set up and 15 kilometers of lanes are currently being planned or under construction.\nMadrid. The Spanish capital has just 43 kilometers of cycle lanes, including some physically separated from motor vehicle traffic and others simply marked with paint. It is the only city to be dismantling existing lanes rather than creating new ones.\nWith reporting by Clara Blanchar, Sandro Pozzi, Daniel Verd\u00fa and Enrique M\u00fcller.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/08/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
