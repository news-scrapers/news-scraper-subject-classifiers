Each bird lives in a space the size of a sheet of paper and never sees the sun. Their beaks are trimmed and they endure constant stress as they lay around 470 eggs in a 100-week period. Spain, along with Portugal, is the European leader of the so-called \u201cfurnished-cage\u201d system: 82% of hens are in cages, compared to the average of 52% in the European Union. Indeed, in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden, caged hens make up just over 10% of the total.\nThe egg industry is resisting this change because it is more profitable to keep hens in cages\nSilvia Barquero, Animal Equality Foundation\nSince 2016, these four countries have been backing alternative systems such as free-range eggs, where the chicken is allowed to live in larger spaces, and ecological production, where the birds live outside freely and are given organic feed. The consumer can identify the differences according to the number stamped on the egg \u2013 zero for organic, one for free-range eggs, two for indoor and three for furnished cages.\nSpain is also slowly moving toward more animal-friendly systems. Alternative egg production jumped from 7% in 2016 to 17.6% in 2018, according to the Spanish Egg Producer Society (Aseprhu). In other words, around five million hens have escaped furnished cages.\nMar\u00eda del Mar Fern\u00e1ndez Poza, the head of Aseprhu, says the drop is thanks to the big distributors who have decided not to buy eggs from caged hens. According to the animal-rights group, the Animal Equality Foundation, six of Spain\u2019s seven national supermarket chains \u2013 with the exception of Dia \u2013 have publicly committed to protecting animal welfare. \u201cIf you are restricting the sale of [caged] eggs, you are conditioning the customer to buy what you put in the supermarket,\u201d explains Poza. Ester Mu\u00f1oz Gil, the head of external relations at Guill\u00e9n Eggs, one of Spain\u2019s largest farms, says that all egg production is set to be cage-free by 2025.\nIn Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden, caged hens make up just over 10% of the total\n\u201cThis trend is also rising due to the pressure animal organizations have placed on food-distribution companies,\u201d says Poza.\nSince 2017, the Animal Equality Foundation has been protesting outside supermarkets to make customers aware of the terrible conditions of caged hens. Silvia Barquero, the president of the foundation, deplores the fact that Spain is the leader of \u201canimal abuse\u201d in Europe. \u201cThe egg industry is resisting this change because it is economically more profitable to keep hens in cages,\u201d she says.\nAccording to the 2012 EU directive on caged hens, each bird must be given a space of at least 750 square centimeters \u2013 the size of an A4 piece of paper \u2013 as well as nests and perches. But Deborah Temple, a researcher in animal behavior and welfare from the Autonomous University of Barcelona, says this system \u201cfalls short.\u201d\nAccording to a Eurobarometer survey on animal protection, 75% of Europeans believe animal welfare on farms needs to be improved. However, 90% of those surveyed are not willing to spend more for products that come from farms where animals have better living conditions. There is considerable difference in the market price of eggs. An egg from a caged hen costs around \u20ac0.15, while a free-range egg costs \u20ac0.25, and ecological eggs \u20ac0.50.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/29/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
