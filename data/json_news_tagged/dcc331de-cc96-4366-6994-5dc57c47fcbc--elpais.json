The British travel group, which ceased activity on Monday after failing to secure funding, is one of the largest sources of tourists to Spain, bringing around 3.6 million passengers to the country every year.\nSpanish companies, especially in the Canary and Balearic Islands, where Thomas Cook brought in an annual 3.2 million visitors, fear the collapse could lead to millions of euros in losses, while Spain\u2019s CGT labor union has also warned that thousands of jobs could be at risk.\nMore than 13,000 jobs are at risk in the Canary Islands, according to the CGT labor union\nReyes Maroto, Spain\u2019s caretaker industry, trade and tourism minister, will meet on Tuesday with representatives from the Spanish regions hardest hit by the fall of Thomas Cook \u2013 Canary Islands, Catalonia, Balearic Islands and Andalusia \u2013 to prepare a plan to mitigate the effects of the group\u2019s demise.\nThomas Cook was one of the five largest international hotel operators in Spain, with three airlines (Condor, Thomas Cook Airlines and Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia), and a fleet of 105 planes. In Spain, the group manages 63 hotels, most of which belong to one of eight hotel chains. These hotels employ 2,500 workers and provide 12,000 of the 40,000 beds offered by Thomas Cook in Europe. What\u2019s more, Thomas Cook had made more than one million reservations for the coming months, many of them in Spain. The Meli\u00e1 hotel chain announced on Monday that it would refund the reservations made by Thomas Cook customers who were planning on staying at the hotel.\nA million visitors travel to the Balearic Islands every year on Thomas Cook flights \u2013 15% of all visitors to the archipelago, the Hotel Chain Group said on Monday. The Mallorca Hotel Federation (FEHM) admitted that it was \u201can unprecedented situation\u201d and said it was considering asking authorities to adopt financial measures to help businesses whose future is \u201cseriously compromised\u201d by the Thomas Cook collapse.\nMeanwhile, in the Canary Islands, the British travel group is responsible for 25% of all visitors, according to the hotel sector. In the Canary Islands, the CGT labor union warned that the closure of the company would affect the job stability of more than 10% of workers in the hotel sector, which employs around 135,000 on the islands.\nThe situation in the Canary Islands is particularly precarious, given that low-cost airline Ryanair has already announced plans to shut down its base on the island of Tenerife. If Condor halts its Canary Islands operations, the area could be left without a large proportion of its connecting flights. The president of the Hotel and Tourist Accommodation Confederation (CEGHAT), Juan Molas, asked the Spanish government on Monday to call on Ryanair to reverse its decision and demand the Spanish airport authority AENA reduce airport taxes by 40%.\nOn Monday, caretaker Tourism Minister Maroto told national radio that her department is working to ensure the German and Norwegian affiliates of Thomas Cook continue operating.\nAccording to data from the Tourist Excellence Alliance, Exceltur, Thomas Cook owes more than \u20ac200 million to the Spanish tourism sector. Sources from the industry say that Thomas Cook settled invoices after 90 days, meaning that many bills from the summer season have been left unpaid. This money is owed not only to the hotel sector but also to the service industry and to AENA, executive deputy president of Exceltur, Jos\u00e9 Luis Zoreda, explained to Spanish news agency EFE.\nWhile 60% of the figure is owed to the hotel sector, bus companies, rental car services, guides and excursions \u2013 in other words the services provided by the tour operator in their holiday packages \u2013 have also been affected.\nWhile news of Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse had a positive effect on the Spanish online travel agency eDreams, whose share price went up 2.24% on Monday, it hurt other Spanish companies. Shares in the airline holding company IAG, which owns BA and Iberia, fell 1.61%, AENA was down 1.28% and Amadeus IT Group, a supplier for the tourism industry, shed 3.71%.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/24/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
