Over international waters of the Baltic Sea NATO\u2019s F-18 tried to approach it but the Russian fighter jets forced it away.\u201d\nSpanish military sources said that the F-18 was sent to identify the aircraft, as it was flying near the Alliance\u2019s airspace without a flight plan or IFF identification, which is used in military and civilian air traffic control.\nThis is not the first incident between Spanish and Russian aircraft, as the latter have repeatedly approached Baltic air space without identifying themselves.\nThe Spanish Defense Ministry declined to comment on the incident, saying the F-18 is participating in a NATO mission. A NATO spokeswoman said that \u201ca Russian plane, escorted by at least one Russian combat aircraft, was tracked today [Tuesday] over the Baltic.\u201d The spokesperson said that NATO\u2019s air policing mission jets approached to identify the airplane, which was flying near Allied air space. Once identification was completed, the NATO jets returned to their base. \u201cNATO has no information about who was on board,\u201d said this source.\nSince 2004, Spanish fighter jets have participated on six occasions in NATO air policing missions over the Baltic states, which lack their own combat aircraft.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/14/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
