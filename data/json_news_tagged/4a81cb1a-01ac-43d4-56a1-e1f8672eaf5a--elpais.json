The ruling will be made public early next week, and it is expected that the seven justices who heard the case have sought a unanimous decision.\nIt is believed that at least nine convictions will be handed down because nine defendants remain in custody after being arrested in late October 2017, but penalties will vary depending on each defendant\u2019s participation in the secession attempt.\nThe crime of rebellion requires an element of violence, and in this particular case, it had to be proven that the defendants instigated violence as a tool to achieve independence from Spain. According to legal sources briefed on the matter, the court has found that the defendants did not commit these actions.\nThe defendants could still be found guilty of sedition, among other possibilities. The difference between rebellion and sedition is that the former seeks to modify the Spanish state\u2019s structure by violating the law and instigating street violence, while the latter encourages riotous acts in order to prevent the application of the law.\nThe sedition charge was brought by Spain\u2019s Solicitor General, who represents the Spanish state in the courts and answers to the Justice Ministry. Unlike the public prosecution, this body did not pursue rebellion charges and instead focused on the lesser crimes of sedition and misuse of public funds, seeking a maximum prison term of 12 years for Catalan Republican Left (ERC) leader Oriol Junqueras, who served as deputy premier of Catalonia during the breakaway attempt.\nAlso awaiting sentencing are Jordi S\u00e0nchez and Jordi Cuixart, the former heads of two civil society groups that campaigned actively for independence, and Carme Forcadell, the former speaker of the Catalan parliament.\nThe Supreme Court justices concluded that there were several days of street violence during the breakaway bid: on referendum day and before that, on September 20 and 21, when a crowd of around 40,000 independence supporters gathered in front of the building that houses the Catalan economy department, where a police raid was taking place in search of referendum-related documents.\nThis mass gathering, which was organized by the civil society groups Assemblea Nacional Catalana (ANC) and \u00d2mnium Cultural (then headed by S\u00e0nchez and Cuixart, respectively), aimed to intimidate and hinder the work of the court-appointed envoys in charge of the search, according to prosecutors. Civil Guard vehicles sustained damage during the protests, but the Supreme Court has not found evidence that these were organized with the specific goal of achieving independence by force.\nThe same sources said that the justices also found violence in citizens\u2019 resistance against the riot police that was sent in to stop the unauthorized referendum from taking place on October 1, but that these acts did not constitute rebellion.\nThe former members of the Catalan government are also facing the possibility of being found guilty of misuse of public funds over the use of public money to organize the referendum. This crime is punishable with two to four years in prison, which can be raised to 12 if there are aggravating circumstances.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/11/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
