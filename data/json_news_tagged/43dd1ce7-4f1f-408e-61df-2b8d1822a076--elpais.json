And the far-right party Vox surged to become the third-largest force in Congress with 52 representatives.\nAnd so a deal that had seemed impossible for all of six months suddenly became a reality in a one-hour meeting at La Moncloa, the seat of government. On Tuesday S\u00e1nchez and Unidas Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias signed a preliminary agreement and embraced in front of the cameras.\nBut the combination of PSOE and Unidas Podemos only yields 155 seats, well short of the 176 required for a parliamentary majority. Both parties lost a collective 1.5 million votes from the April election, representing 10 seats in Congress. In order to form a government, S\u00e1nchez and Iglesias will need endorsement from other parties, and almost certainly an abstention at the investiture vote by the separatist party Catalan Republican Left (ERC).\nForming a government in the current scenario of political fragmentation will be harder than ever\nThis could prove tricky after S\u00e1nchez adopted a tougher tone on Catalonia in the final days of campaigning in a bid to attract undecided voters in the political center.\nIn fact, forming a government in the current scenario of political fragmentation will be harder than ever. If ERC refuses to abstain and the center-right Ciudadanos, which suffered a crushing defeat on Sunday, continues to vote against S\u00e1nchez, the latter will fail to get himself returned to office, and Spain could be facing yet another repeat election.\nAs he followed the vote count from his fourth-floor office at party headquarters on Ferraz street in Madrid, an exhausted S\u00e1nchez figured that he had to close a fast-track deal with Podemos\u2019 Pablo Iglesias.\nIglesias had lobbied hard for such a coalition following the April election, but S\u00e1nchez had rejected his conditions. The Podemos leader had in turn spurned the PM\u2019s alternative offer of a few positions below the Cabinet level.\nBut on Sunday night, S\u00e1nchez saw that the option he had earlier rejected was now the only way out of the impasse. \u201cA politician\u2019s best diet is to eat his own words,\u201d said former Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy a month ago, paraphrasing Winston Churchill and possibly anticipating what was about to unfold in Spain.\nAs he contemplated the fiasco of the repeat election \u2013 the fourth in four years \u2013 S\u00e1nchez made a U-turn and decided to accept a coalition government with Unidas Podemos in which Pablo Iglesias would be one of his top deputies.\nThe deal is not complete yet, but sources familiar with the negotiation said it will be similar to the one that both leaders nearly clinched in July, giving Unidas Podemos one deputy PM position and three ministerial portfolios.\nFollowing the preliminary agreement by S\u00e1nchez and Iglesias, two top aides \u2013 Adriana Lastra for the PSOE and Irene Montero for Unidas Podemos \u2013 began working on the details of a set of guidelines for a four-year governing program.\nThe issue of Catalonia, which had seemed like an insurmountable obstacle between both parties, was quickly resolved with a preliminary agreement that talks about finding \u201cformulas for mutual understanding and common ground\u201d and seeking solutions to the territorial crisis \u201cwithin the bounds of the Constitution.\u201d Unidas Podemos had earlier defended the idea of a legal independence referendum for the region, which the PSOE rejected as unconstitutional.\nBoth men are aware that they need to work together or there will be no government in Spain, and they know that another repeat election could make the political right even stronger.\nIf the plan secures parliamentary endorsement, this will be Spain\u2019s first left-wing coalition since the days of the Second Republic, which lasted from 1931 to 1939, when the end of the Spanish Civil War gave way to the Franco dictatorship.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/13/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
