Hundreds of people were injured in the week-long skirmishes in Barcelona and other Catalan cities. Barcelona city officials have estimated the damage to street furniture at \u20ac2.7 million.\nThe street protests began on Monday of last week, when the Supreme Court announced its decision sentencing nine separatist leaders to prison for sedition in connection with the unilateral secession attempt of 2017.\nThe independence movement had said that it would only accept a full acquittal, and responded with large mobilizations organized through social media by a leaderless group called Democratic Tsunami, which looks to the Hong Kong protests for inspiration. The largely peaceful daytime demonstrations descended into violence for five nights in a row, led by groups of young radicals.\nTorra has denounced police violence, and instructed the head of the regional interior department, Miquel Buch, to conduct \u201cthe necessary investigations\u201d into the Catalan police force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, who worked together with Spain\u2019s National Police to contain the radical protesters.\nThe Catalan interior department routinely presses charges in cases where there are injured Mossos. It did so on Wednesday, when it sought prison terms for four individuals who were arrested during an attempt to surround the Spanish government\u2019s delegation headquarters in Barcelona. Since then, however, no charges have been brought against 30 other people being held in custody on allegations of criminal behavior.\nAn official government spokesperson denied any change in attitude, but sources at the Barcelona prosecution services, at the Catalonia High Court and at the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra have confirmed this lack of prosecutorial action.\nOfficials at the regional law enforcement agency, which answers to the Catalan government, say they feel abandoned.\n\u201cWe feel completely defenseless. This affects the defense of our officers,\u201d said one Mossos source. \u201cOne could understand it if they investigated some of the [police] actions, but you can\u2019t understand how they are leaving you legally defenseless.\u201d\nSources at the Catalan interior department said that they will press charges later on. And the mayor of Girona, Marta Madrenas of the separatist party Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia), said the city would press charges against the police for \u201carbitrary and uncontrolled\u201d behavior.\nIn recent days, leaders of the independence movement have been requesting the resignation of Catalan interior chief Buch and an end to \u201cthe police repression.\u201d While the regional premier condemned the violence by a minority of protesters last week, Torra has placed the emphasis on the police. On Tuesday, he insisted on the need for \u201caccountability\u201d at the regional law-enforcement agency. Unions have called his statements \u201cindecent.\u201d\nMeanwhile, a recently created agency called the Office of Civil and Political Rights has expressed support for the arrested protesters and criticized police action as well. \u201cWe have witnessed abusive and punitive use of force, although we have received a more negative assessment about the National Police than about the Mossos,\u201d said the agency\u2019s director, Adam Maj\u00f3, who is a former leader of the separatist, anti-capitalist CUP party. Maj\u00f3 admitted that some of the radical protesters\u2019 actions \u201cwent beyond freedom of assembly,\u201d but insisted that the police\u2019s response has created \u201csocial alarm.\u201d\nAnd the S\u00edndic de greuges, Catalonia\u2019s ombudsman agency, has also opened an investigation into the police\u2019s actions. This body has sent a letter to the EU Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatovich, to inform her of this investigation.\nFollowing the unauthorized independence referendum of October 1, 2017, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra were accused by Madrid of failing to adequately comply with orders to stop the vote from taking place. At that time, the law-enforcement agency\u2019s loyalty was questioned, and its former chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, is facing a trial of his own for rebellion and sedition in connection with the breakaway attempt.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/23/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
