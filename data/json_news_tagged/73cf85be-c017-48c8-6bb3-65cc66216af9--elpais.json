There has also been a 30% increase in violent theft. In May, the Catalan police created a dedicated team to monitor groups of youths who are blamed for many of the violent crimes committed in downtown Barcelona.\nOn August 21, the US Embassy in Spain issued a security alert warning citizens about \u201can increase in violent crime in the city of Barcelona in the summer of 2019, specifically in popular tourist areas.\u201d\nThe latest example of coordinated police work took place on Tuesday, when Mossos and National Police officers acted against pickpockets on the subway network.\nThe Mossos are already familiar with around a hundred individuals who have been arrested multiple times for stealing from commuters. But this time, after the arrests, the National Police checked the suspects\u2019 legal status in Spain.\nOfficers identified 70 people, 30 of whom were taken to the police station in La Verneda. After checking their documents, the National Police held 22 individuals for violating immigration laws, and those with a long criminal record will face deportation.\nThe Mossos are familiar with around a hundred individuals who have been arrested multiple times for stealing from commuters\nA Mossos official in charge of security on the public transit system said that the goal of the joint police work was to \u201ccatch recidivists in the act of stealing and check their legal status.\u201d\nA total of 221 pickpockets have restraining orders banning them from going on the subway. Between 2016 and 2019, the Mossos provided evidence on 2,490 occasions to secure this type of legal action against repeat offenders.\nBoth law enforcement agencies are planning to repeat Tuesday\u2019s operation periodically, although they did not specify how often that would be. The National Police insisted that they are not conducting indiscriminate checks on foreigners but rather \u201cselective identification of criminals.\u201d\nAlthough both police forces cooperate frequently on a number of issues, these crime-busting operations in Barcelona are jointly designed. This is partly due to the fact that in November 2018, the Mossos were admitted into the Intelligence Center Against Terrorism and Organized Crime (CITCO), a body that coordinates ongoing investigations by each law enforcement agency in Spain.\nRelations between the Mossos and the National Police have also improved with new appointments to top positions in both agencies following the unauthorized independence referendum of October 1, 2017 in Catalonia. Officials noted that these changes have helped repair a relationship that had deteriorated during the secession attempt by Catalan separatists.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/28/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
