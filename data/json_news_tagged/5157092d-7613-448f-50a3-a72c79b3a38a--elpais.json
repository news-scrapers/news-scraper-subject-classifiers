Puigdemont remained in Brussels, while Ponsat\u00ed later settled in Scotland.\nSpain\u2019s Supreme Court reactivated European arrest warrants for Ponsat\u00ed and two other former members of the Catalan government \u2013 Toni Com\u00edn and Llu\u00eds Puig \u2013 in early November, a month after handing down a decision in the trial of 12 other leaders of the 2017 secession bid.\nThe former regional minister handed herself in to police station in Edinburgh on Thursday, after the United Kingdom agreed to process the new warrant for her arrest.
