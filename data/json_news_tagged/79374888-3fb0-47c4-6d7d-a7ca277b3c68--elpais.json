Pablo Casado of the Popular Party (PP) Albert Rivera of Ciudadanos (Citizens) and Pablo Iglesias of Unidas Podemos will meet with S\u00e1nchez individually. The country is facing a repeat general election on November 10.\nThe Catalan premier, Quim Torra, is also meeting with some of his top aides this morning to discuss the events of Tuesday, which resulted in 51 arrests and left 125 people injured, 72 of them police officers, according to Catalan health services.\nArrests were made in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Sabadell after protesters lit fires and erected makeshift barricades on the streets of major Catalan cities to protest the Supreme Court ruling that handed down prison terms to leaders of the illegal breakaway bid of 2017. These nine leaders have condemned the recent violence in a Twitter message.\nProtests continued on Wednesday morning with new cuts to the high-speed railroad service AVE between Barcelona and Figueres (Girona), and roadblocks on the A-2 and AP-7 motorways.\nTot el suport a les mobilitzacions i a les marxes massives i pac\u00edfiques. Cap viol\u00e8ncia ens representa. pic.twitter.com/lQJlqxqkMC\n\u201cAll our support for the mobilizations and the massive, peaceful marches. Violence does not represent us.\u201d\nDramatic scenes were seen on Tuesday night in Barcelona, where firefighters worked to put out the flames on Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia and riot police remained stationed on the central boulevard well into the night, while helicopters hovered overhead.\nWhile a grassroots pro-independence organization called Assemblea Nacional Catalana (ANC) had called for sit-ins outside the Spanish government\u2019s delegations across Catalonia, several hundred demonstrators turned the peaceful protests into street battles, setting fire to trash containers, erecting barricades and hurling objects at riot officers from the national and Catalan law enforcement agencies, who responded with baton and rubber bullet charges.\nThe disturbances were particularly serious in Barcelona, where around 40,000 people had congregated according to local police estimates. They followed an earlier day of protesting on Monday, when thousands of independence supporters blocked access routes to Josep Tarradelles-El Prat airport, causing more than 100 flight cancellations.\nThe Committees to Defend the Republic (CDR), a grassroots network that advocates direct action, has already described these events as \u201cRosa de foc\u201d, or \u201crose of fire,\u201d the name given to the city of Barcelona during the so-called Tragic Week of late July 1909, where violent confrontations between the Spanish army and working classes, who were against the calling-up of reserve troops to fight in Morocco, resulted in around 80 deaths in street clashes.\nAt 11.28pm on Tuesday, the caretaker government issued a release stating that \u201cwe are seeing generalized violence in all the protests,\u201d and that this violence \u201cis not the result of a peaceful citizen movement, but is being coordinated by groups that use street violence to break the social harmony in Catalonia.\u201d\n\u201cA minority is trying to impose violence on the streets of Catalan cities,\u201d added the statement, which acknowledged the joint work of the Catalan police force (Mossos d\u2019Esquadra), the National Police and the Civil Guard. The note said that the government\u2019s goal is \u201cto guarantee security and peaceful coexistence in Catalonia.\u201d\nPablo Casado, the leaders of the main opposition Popular Party (PP), on Tuesday night asked S\u00e1nchez to activate the National Security Law in Catalonia, a piece of legislation that lets \u201cthe relevant authorities contribute the necessary human and material resources\u201d to maintain public order.\n\u201cIn light of the violent disturbances increasing the tension in Catalonia, S\u00e1nchez must activate the National Security Law so that no police agency is subject to instructions from separatists and to protect its integrity. It is urgent that we guarantee security and public order,\u201d wrote Casado on Twitter.\nThe executive has already said that it will only take measures if the Catalan police is not doing its job, which it feels is not the case right now. The Mossos\u2019 actions have been questioned in the past in connection with October 1, 2017 when the unauthorized independence referendum took place.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/16/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
