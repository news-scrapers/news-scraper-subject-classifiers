For 11 days, there was an extensive search for the child in which Quezada actively participated, making public shows of support for Gabriel\u2019s father, with whom she was in a relationship.\nThe Civil Guard officer, one of seven witnesses to take the stand at the Almer\u00eda provincial court on Wednesday, said that when they arrested Quezada they found medication inside her purse: \u201cMuscle relaxants, diazepam. Two blisters, no more than 12 pills.\u201d This would be an insufficient amount to take her own life, as Quezada told the court she meant to do after killing Gabriel. Inside the house she shared with Gabriel\u2019s father, \u00c1ngel Cruz, officers found a small amount of cocaine but nothing to support her claim that she was going to commit suicide by overdosing on medication.\nThis witness also told the court that Quezada\u2019s frequent visits to the property where she\u2019d buried the child \u2013 a rural home in Rodalquilar that was being renovated \u2013 was to check that no animal had dug up the body, especially since there was an unusual spell of rain during those days. \u201cThat\u2019s why her visits were so short: she checked that everything was all right, and left again,\u201d said the Civil Guard lieutenant.\nAnother witness, Civil Guard Captain Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zalvide, said they became immediately suspicious of Quezada after she twice claimed to have lost her cellphone, and later after she planted a t-shirt that had belonged to Gabriel at a spot near the house of a former partner of hers, Sergio Melguizo, in an apparent attempt to falsely incriminate him.\nA third Civil Guard witness who interrogated Quezada on March 3, the day that the shirt was found, was asked if the accused had ever shown signs of remorse.\n\u201cNot on that day nor on any other day,\u201d he replied.\nThe jury heard Quezada described as \u201ccold and calculating\u201d by a Civil Guard captain from Burgos, the city where the accused first lived after moving to Spain from Dominican Republic. Quezada was investigated there when her four-year-old daughter died after falling out of a window in 1996. The case was ultimately dismissed as an accident.\nGabriel\u2019s uncle Francisco Cruz also took the stand on Wednesday, and said that on a visit to the Rodalquilar estate following the child\u2019s disappearance, he was puzzled to see a shovel, an ax and a rake placed in a meticulous row, \u201clike when you take a test and place your pens neatly on the desk.\u201d He knew that his brother \u00c1ngel did not keep tools there, because they had all been taken to another family property. If Quezada brought the tools with her to the property, it would support the accusation that the murder was premeditated.\nQuezada has confessed to killing Gabriel but maintains that it was not planned. While she originally told the police that she was trying to get rid of the body on the day she was arrested, she has since changed her version of events and now claims that she meant to leave the body in the car, write letters to the family asking for forgiveness, and take her own life with pills.\nHer defense is seeking a conviction for reckless homicide, which entails a maximum prison term of 15 years. The accusation says it is murder and wants the maximum penalty: permanent reviewable prison \u2013 the equivalent of life with a possibility of parole after a fixed term.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/12/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
