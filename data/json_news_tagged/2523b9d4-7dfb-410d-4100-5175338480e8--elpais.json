Some allowed it in the indoor pool while others have confined the practice to certain areas, such as the solarium or to the outdoor pool, restrictions that have been denounced by the women\u2019s organization Mugrons Lliures as gender discrimination.\nIn response, the Office Against Discrimination has drawn up a report that says, \u201cImposing rules of dress specifically for women means restricting their freedom of choice and is gender discrimination.\u201d\nBased on the report, the Barcelona Sports Institute has contacted the 14 public centers with pools in Barcelona, asking them not to ban topless bathing.\nIn the Picornell swimming center, topless bathing is nothing new. The director of the center, Jaume Serna, explains that it is normal there for a number of women to sunbathe topless at the outdoor pool. He adds that they received the City Hall\u2019s missive at the end of July. \u201cIt is a message of reinforcement,\u201c says Serna who adds that he totally respects the \u201cfreedom of each and every person\u201d when it comes to choosing swimwear. Although there are not many takers, bathers are also allowed to go topless at the Picornell indoor pool. In fact, Picornell is the only center in Barcelona with a time slot for nudists.\nFollowing the City Hall\u2019s intervention on the matter, the Club Nataci\u00f3 Atl\u00e8tic-Barceloneta has confirmed on social media that bathers \u201ccan now enjoy all the pools in an atmosphere of complete equality\u201d as there is no longer a regulation with regard to going topless. Meanwhile, staff at the Can Caralleu pool in Sarri\u00e0, say they are not aware of the change in policy and explain that up to now women have been allowed to go topless in the solarium but not in the indoor pools which are used for sport.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/09/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
