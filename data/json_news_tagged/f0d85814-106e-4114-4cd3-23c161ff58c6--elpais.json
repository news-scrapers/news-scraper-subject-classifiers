Today, after particularly aggressive attacks on police by groups of demonstrators in Barcelona on Friday night, the hardline pro-independence leader only went as far as to call for \u201cresponsibility\u201d and request a meeting with caretaker Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to begin \u201cthe dialogue\u201d that the independence movement has been demanding for months.\nWe call on S\u00e1nchez to set a date and a time to open up negotiations with no prior conditions in order to speak and to have a dialogue\nCatalan regional premier Quim Torra\nTorra has refused to take questions this week when he has appeared before the press, and has only made institutional statements and participated in an interview on TV3, conducted by the regional public TV channel\u2019s director, Vicent Sanchis. The street violence in Catalonia this week has done very little to alter Torra\u2019s rhetoric, beyond a generalized condemnation of violent protests.\n\u201cWe call on S\u00e1nchez to set a date and a time to open up negotiations with no prior conditions in order to speak and to have a dialogue,\u201d Torra said on Saturday in Barcelona after meeting with his deputy premier, Pere Aragon\u00e8s, as well as the mayors of Lleida, Tarragona and Girona \u2013 all of them in favor of independence for Catalonia.\nThe cause for freedom is unstoppable and we will go as far as the people of Catalonia want to go\nCatalan regional premier Quim Torra\n\u201cNo form of violence represents us,\u201d he continued on Saturday. \u201cWe are represented by the exercising of democracy and freedom.\u201d The Catalan premier once again called on PM S\u00e1nchez, of the Socialist Party (PSOE), to sit down for talks in order to \u201cfind a way out\u201d of the situation that has arisen in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling. \u201cThe cause for freedom is unstoppable and we will go as far as the people of Catalonia want to go.\u201d\nTorra added that S\u00e1nchez had an \u201cobligation\u201d to sit down for talks and as such he called for \u201cresponsibility.\u201d \u201cWe have been asking for a long time for a political response to the conflict and it is more urgent than ever today,\u201d Torra continued. \u201cThe independence movement is cross-sectional and peaceful. We saw that yesterday,\u201d he said, in reference to a peaceful march that attracted more than half-a-million protestors. \u201cBuilding that reputation takes years,\u201d he insisted, before defending pacifism and stating that \u201cviolence has never been our flag.\u201d\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/19/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
