Sources close to the investigation said the body had a strong blow to the head, suggesting a fall.\nThe former skier was found by an off-duty Civil Guard officer and his dog, who were part of the largest search operation ever rolled out in the Madrid region: 100 National Police officers, 100 members of the Civil Guard, 60 volunteers from the civil protection services and 11 municipal police officers. Helicopters, drones, horses and dogs were also employed to comb the mountainous area.\nFern\u00e1ndez Ochoa was last seen alive on August 24, first at an Hipercor supermarket in Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n, and later in Cercedilla where a local resident saw her headed for the area where she was found on Wednesday.\nHer relatives began to worry when she failed to come home and did not get in touch. She also left her cellphone behind.\nFern\u00e1ndez Ochoa had recently moved in with her sister and brother-in-law after getting divorced from her second husband and selling the family home in Las Rozas. Her two children, Olivia and David, were living with their father.\nThe former Olympic champion\u2019s car, a black Mercedes, was located in a parking area for hikers in Las Dehesas, two kilometers from Cercedilla. Inside the vehicle the police found a small purse with her ID card, her driver\u2019s license and \u20ac15 in cash.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated terrain, very steep and with thick vegetation, with rivers, rocky outcrops and lots of fern that hinder visibility, even at close range,\u201d said two officers from the National Police\u2019s special ops unit GEO who had just climbed half-way up one of the Seven Peaks, the skier\u2019s favorite mountain.\nBlanca Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa belonged to a family with a long tradition in sports. The Ochoas were also something of an institution in Cercedilla, where there is a monument to Francisco (Paquito) Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa outside city hall for his achievements at the Sapporo Games of 1972. Cercedilla is also where his sister Blanca was carried by a crowd on their shoulders after she won bronze in the slalom at the Albertville Games in 1992.\nAfter ending her career, she had taken up other sports such as golf, and participated in a few reality shows on television. Most recently she had been making a living as a personal trainer, just like her sister Lola, but her financial situation was described by family members as \u201cvery precarious.\u201d\n\u201cShe had no credit cards and just one bank account with a balance of zero euros,\u201d said her brother-in-law Adri\u00e1n Federighi.\nAn autopsy will be performed on her body to determine the cause of death, and a large funeral is expected in her memory. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad she will never be able to see how much people love her,\u201d said her sister Lola.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/04/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
