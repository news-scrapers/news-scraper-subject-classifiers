These two groups called the protest outside the economy department while the court-ordered raid was taking place inside.\nAngels Pi\u00f1ol\nThe Catalan government has made its own assessment of the Amnesty report. While omitting the part that considered the trial fair, authorities underscored the use of the terms \u201cdisproportionate,\u201d \u201crestrictive,\u201d \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d to describe the court\u2019s interpretation of the crime of sedition. Dami\u00e0 Calvet, the regional chief of territory and sustainability, said that such a report would make him \u201cfeel great shame\u201d if he were part of the Spanish justice system. \u201cOur decision is the same: the trial was unfair and so was the ruling.\u201d\n\u201cThey should never have been jailed for events that were eminently peaceful, as the judgement acknowledges,\u201d said Beltr\u00e1n.\nThe organization considers that the nine-year convictions for sedition handed down to S\u00e0nchez and Cuixart \u201cviolate their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.\u201d These convictions \u201cmust be quashed,\u201d said Daniel Joloy, senior policy advisor at Amnesty International.\nThe rights group believes that \u201cas private citizens and leaders of civil society organizations, Jordi S\u00e0nchez and Jordi Cuixart had a right to express their opinions and to organize peaceful meetings to support the referendum and the independence of Catalonia.\n\u201cEven if the purpose of any of these meetings or their actions was to prevent the enforcement of a judicial resolution, peaceful civil disobedience is also protected under international human rights law,\u201d the report adds.\n\u201cBringing overly-harsh charges to acts of civil disobedience unduly restricts the right to peaceful assembly and breaches international law,\u201d the report continues. According to Beltr\u00e1n, the Supreme Court \u201cfailed to demonstrate that the imposition of such severe penalties was proportionate to the peaceful acts of which they were accused.\u201d\nAmnesty further finds that that the former members of the Catalan government who were convicted, as well as Catalan parliament speaker Carme Forcadell, \u201cmight have committed an offense that could have been legitimately prosecuted,\u201d but that their conviction for sedition is \u201cin breach of the principle of legality according to international standards.\u201d\nThe organization wants prosecutors to appeal to the Constitutional Court to secure a sentence reduction. This would be a significant shift for the public prosecution, which had been seeking much higher penalties on rebellion charges.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/21/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
