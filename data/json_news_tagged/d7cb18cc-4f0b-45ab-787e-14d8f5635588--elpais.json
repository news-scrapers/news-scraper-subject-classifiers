She has thus become the first woman to be given the new punishment since its introduction several years ago.\nQuezada has been ordered to pay each of Gabriel\u2019s parents \u20ac250,000 in moral damages\nOn September 20, Quezada was found guilty by a jury in Almer\u00eda, southern Spain, of the 2018 murder of the youngster, who was the son of her then-partner, \u00c1ngel Cruz.\nThe sentence, which was delivered to the relevant parties on Monday, finds her the author of the crime of murder with the aggravating circumstance of kinship to the victim. She has also been convicted of two offenses of psychological abuse against the child\u2019s parents, given that she actively participated in the more than 10-day search for the youngster after his disappearance, despite having buried his body in a shallow grave on a property belonging to Cruz. She has been given a three-year sentence for that crime against the father and a two-year, nine-month sentence for the crime against the mother.\nThe Provincial Court in Almer\u00eda has also forbidden Quezada from living in or visiting the municipality of N\u00edjar or the place of residence of Gabriel\u2019s parents for the next 30 years. She is also banned from coming within 500 meters of Gabriel\u2019s mother and father.\nShe has been ordered to pay each of Gabriel\u2019s parents \u20ac250,000 in moral damages and cover the cost to the state of the extensive search for the boy: a total of \u20ac200,203.\nThe jurors spent two days deciding whether Quezada, a 45-year-old immigrant from Dominican Republic, committed murder or reckless homicide, as her defense argued. They also debated whether aggravating circumstances such as premeditation applied, as held by both the public and the private prosecution.\nThey concluded, in agreement with the public prosecutor, that she killed the child in an intentional and sudden way, using means to ensure his death without running any risk herself, and abusing his trust as a member of the family. The jury did not, however, find that there was premeditation nor did they conclude that she deliberately increased the suffering of the child, as the private prosecution held. They also refused her defense that she was acting under the effects of sleeping pills.\nGabriel Cruz went missing on February 27, 2018 in Las Hortichuelas, a hamlet located inside Cabo de Gata natural park, a sparsely populated area in Almer\u00eda.\nQuezada, who was then in a romantic relationship with the child\u2019s father, \u00c1ngel Cruz, confessed to the killing after police caught her moving the eight-year-old\u2019s body in the trunk of her car.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/30/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
