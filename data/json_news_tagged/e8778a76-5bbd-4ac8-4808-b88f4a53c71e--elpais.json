Commission sources admitted on Tuesday, however, that it is in touch with several member states in a bid to end the crisis.\nSpanish government sources have suggested that the executive is also involved in the effort. \u201cFrom the beginning, we have been working on a common European solution,\u201d said a source, declining to provide more specific details.\nOther sources familiar with the talks said that the European Commission has been working informally for several days on a migrant distribution scheme, although it was unclear whether Spain would be a part.\nThe Spanish executive says that taking in the migrants that Italy rejects would be tantamount to accepting the logic of the Italian interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who has closed off its ports to non-profit rescue ships. Ever since Salvini took a hard line against aid groups in June of last year, around 2,000 people have been stranded for days at sea before being allowed to disembark, according to Commission figures.\nOn the other hand, refusing to participate in a distribution scheme would reflect poorly on the government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez, of the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE). S\u00e1nchez initially took a welcoming attitude to these rescue efforts, taking in hundreds of migrants last year who had been refused entry by Malta and Italy.\nThere is a second rescue ship in the area awaiting permission for port entry\nBut Spain has since abandoned these unilateral initiatives, and aid groups say that authorities are no longer authorizing them to leave ports on rescue missions with the argument that the vessels are not properly equipped for such journeys.\nSpain is also under migratory pressure from Morocco, the departure point for many more migrants than those making the central Mediterranean crossing this year. Spanish authorities want the European distribution scheme to include not just the migrants departing from Libya, as France and Germany suggest, but also those rescued on the Strait of Gibraltar and the westernmost part of the Mediterranean, known as the Alboran Sea.\nMeanwhile, conditions on the ship continue to deteriorate. Several people have had to be evacuated for medical reasons, including two nine-month-old babies, one with respiratory problems, and their families. But 147 migrants remain on board.\nAnd there is a second rescue ship in the area, the Ocean Viking, operated by Doctors Without Borders and SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, which has requested port entry as well. This vessel is carrying 356 people on board, including 74 minors.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/14/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
