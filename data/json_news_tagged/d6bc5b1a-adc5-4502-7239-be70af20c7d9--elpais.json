Such a trip had been attempted several times in the past, but was always canceled at the last minute for a variety of reasons. King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia landed in Havana on Monday to seal the full normalization of historically complex relations between both countries.\nCuba was the only Latin American country that the Spanish royals had never visited officially. In 1999 the reigning monarch at the time, Juan Carlos, spent some time in Havana but only as part of a regional summit of state and government leaders.\nDuring their two-day visit to the Cuban capital, the royals will meet with representatives of Spanish businesses on the island. The Spanish government has insisted that the visit, while highly symbolic, does not constitute official support for the government of Cuba.\nThe visit will take place against a complicated backdrop: the US is strengthening its embargo on Cuba, and a newly enforced provision of the Helms-Burton Act opens the door to US lawsuits against businesses that may be \u201ctrafficking\u201d with property that was confiscated after the Cuban revolution.\nThis could potentially affect several Spanish companies, including the hotel chain Meli\u00e1 and the airline Air Europa. In a clear show of support for Spanish interests in Cuba, the royals will stay at the the Iberostar Grand Packard, a major resort in Havana that is on Washington\u2019s blacklist.\nThe Spanish government has insisted that the visit does not constitute official support for the government of Cuba\nThe official agenda begins on Tuesday with a meeting between Felipe VI and the Cuban president, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, at the Palace of the Revolution. Both leaders are expected to sign a Framework Agreement between Cuba and Spain aimed at guiding bilateral cooperation and cultural exchanges over the coming years.\nIn the meantime, Queen Letizia will visit the building restoration workshop Escuela Taller de Restauraci\u00f3n Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, which was founded with Spanish support. Later the royals are scheduled to go on a tour of Old Havana, where they will have lunch at a paladar \u2013 a private, family-run restaurant \u2013 just as Barack and Michelle Obama did in 2016.\nOther activities include a dance performance at the Gran Teatro Alicia Alonso, a dinner offered by the president, and meetings with members of the Spanish community in Havana and with Cuban civil society leaders.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/12/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
