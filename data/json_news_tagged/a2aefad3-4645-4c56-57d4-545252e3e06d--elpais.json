While this is nothing new, what has changed is the number of services that are available to help people cover their tracks.\nIt is a business that generates billions of euros across the world\nChristoph Kraemer, Ashley Madison Europe\nThis booming infidelity business is making inroads in the Spanish market, where there are 11,280,000 marriages and de facto relationships, according to 2018 figures from the National Institute of Statistics (INE), and that is without counting the unregistered relationships.\nThis sector includes everything from dating apps with millions of users around the world, to love hotels that sell discretion by the hour, tools to delete incriminating messages, and even private detectives.\nSo how much money is the cheating business worth? It is impossible to know.\n\u201cBesides the personal ads, there are the hotels, the trips, the presents, the restaurants\u2026 It is a business that generates billions of euros across the world, and it makes an important contribution to GDP,\u201d says Christoph Kraemer, the head of the European department of Ashley Madison, a cheating website.\nCreated in 2002 in Canada, Ashley Madison is the most popular platform for straying partners, with 60 million registered members in 53 countries. Its slogan is \u201cLife is short. Have an affair.\u201d Last year, the platform attracted 442,000 new members per month, and more than 5.3 million in the year \u2013 a 10% increase on 2017 figures, according to consultancy firm Ernst & Young.\nAshley Madison currently has 1.56 million online members from Spain, who are aged between 30 and 40. Spain is the company\u2019s second-largest market in Europe, only behind the United Kingdom, and it ranks ninth in the world \u2013 the United States, Brazil and Canada have the highest number of users. Ashley Madison made its entrance in Spain in 2011 with a controversial billboard in downtown Madrid featuring a photo of former king Don Juan Carlos next to Prince Charles and former US president Bill Clinton, with the slogan: \u201cWhat do they have in common? They should have used Ashley Madison.\u201d In the first three months, 150,000 Spaniards signed up to the network, which reportedly leads to 15,000 affairs a month, 4,500 a day. Men must buy credits to send the first message \u2013 the minimum payment is \u20ac49 (for 100 credits) and the maximum \u20ac249 (1,000 credits) \u2013 but the platform is free for women.\nBut Ashley Madison is not the only platform in the cheating industry. There is also SecondLove, whose slogan is \u201cFlirting is not just for singles;\u201d Victoria Milan, which has 625,000 Spanish members; and Affairland. But the French website Gleedon claims it is the first site that is designed especially for women: \u201cIt is not a site focused on men, like the rest, there are no semi-naked women as a hook, it is not a hyper-sexualized application,\u201d says Silvia Rubies, the head of communications for Gleedon in Spain.\nCheating website Ashley Madison has 1.56 million members in Spain\nGleedon launched in Spain in 2010. The Spanish market is now its third-biggest in Europe, behind France and Italy. It has 5.5 million users worldwide and 700,000 in Spain, 40% of whom are women, who also don\u2019t have to pay to join.\nIt is not just the cheating sites that are big business in Spain. Love hotels, where couples pay for a room by the hour, have also taken off in the country. Instead of gloomy buildings in industrial areas, there are now a number of luxury love hotels in city centers, like Zouk in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, northeast of Madrid, or H Reg\u00e0s, La Paloma, La Fran\u00e7a and Punt14 in Barcelona. All of these establishments rent rooms by the hour. As well as shampoo, guests are offered complimentary condoms and heart-shaped chocolates. Some even allow guests to park directly inside, so they won\u2019t be seen getting out of their car outside the love hotel.\nThe company Luxtal, with hotels in Madrid and Barcelona, tell guests to call the front desk to find out whether the coast is clear: \u201cit will be impossible to cross paths with someone,\u201d according to their website. Rooms cost \u20ac30 the hour, and come with crescent-shaped beds and large mirrors.\nInside Loob hotel in Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz in the Madrid region, guests \u201cdo not see staff or other guests\u201d and enjoy rooms with tantric sofas, sex toys and a jacuzzi. The cost for four hours ranges between \u20ac62 and \u20ac148.\nA love hotel can be up to three times more profitable than a traditional hotel. \u201cBy renting rooms by the hour, they yield much more than a conventional hotel, where a room is only rented by the day, but they have more expenses in terms of staff, clothing, washing and maintenance,\u201d according to Loob.\nSpain now has several luxury love hotels in the center of major cities\nAnother share of the lucrative cheating industry is dominated by mobile applications like Tigertex, which deletes everything \u2013 messages and phone call records \u2013 from a particular number, or Vaulty Stock, which hides secret pictures and video in a personal vault and is now listed on the stock exchange, or Photo Vault, which hides incriminating documents behind a fake calculator.\nPrivate detectives also play a role in the business of extramarital affairs. Enrique Hormiga, the head of the Spanish Association of Professional Private Detectives (APDPE), which has nearly 400 members, says fees are typically between \u20ac55 and \u20ac110 per hour for a surveillance operation that typically lasts no more than three days. While catching cheating partners only makes up eight percent of his own workload, there are private detective companies that specialize in cheating. The company Infidelity for instance, takes on between 150 and 190 cases a year.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/16/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
