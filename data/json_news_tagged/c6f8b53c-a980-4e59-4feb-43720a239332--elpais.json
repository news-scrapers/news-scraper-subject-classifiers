This decision, if carried out, would signify a dangerous escalation of the trade tensions between the EU and the US.\nThe US Department of Trade yesterday shared a list of 150 product classes that could be hit with a 25% tariff, in the case of agri-food products, and a 10% tariff in the case of civil aircraft.\nThe products under threat represented \u20ac930 million worth of Spanish exports to the United States last year, according to calculations made by EL PA\u00cdS based on their US tariff code (known as TARIC in the EU) and DataComex statistics from the Spanish Industry Ministry, which are based on data from the customs office. This analysis is based solely on the first six figures of the tariff code.\nOf this list, olive oil and wine were the most-exported products in 2018. Together they accounted for more than \u20ac600 million of sales. In fact, the two sectors account for more than \u20ac700 million (\u20ac405 million in olive oil and \u20ac299 million in wine) but not all categories and subcategories of each product appear on the US list. In the case of wine, for example, the list of tariffs only refers to the wine made with fresh grapes (not sparkling wine), in less than two-liter bottles, with less than 14% alcohol content.\nOlives, which account for \u20ac155.4 million in exports, are another product that could be affected by the US government\u2019s decision. The list also includes cheese products, such as fresh cheese and cottage cheese, certain categories of frozen pork meat, and several classes of fruit, including clementines (\u20ac80 million in export sales last year) and lemons (\u20ac4.9 million). The list also includes some types of liquor (\u20ac6.2 million) and aircraft (\u20ac6.2 million).\nThe list of products is provisional. The World Trade Organization (WTO) will hold a special meeting of its Dispute Settlement Body on October 14 in Geneva to formally adopt a decision on Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs. This is the last official step before the US president applies the sanctions. The European Commission could impose tariffs on US imports in retaliation, and in turn start a much-feared trade war. \u201cIf the US decides to impose WTO authorized countermeasures, it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have no other option than do the same,\u201d EU Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said in a statement.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/04/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
