In September, the number of applications soared to 50,000, with up to 5,000 requests received in a single day.\nSpain\u2019s Congress passed the law in 2015 to offer historical redress to the descendants of the Jewish community, which was expelled from Spain in 1492. To be awarded citizenship, applicants had to provide certificates and documents proving their origin, appear before a public notary in Spain, pass a Spanish-language examination, and be tested on their knowledge of Spanish politics and culture. From October 1, descendants will no longer be able to apply for Spanish citizenship via this route.\nUntil August 31 this year, only 60,226 applications had been received, but in just the month of September, there were 50,000. In total, more than 100,000 descendants from over 60 different countries have applied for Spanish citizenship.\nThe 2015 law was slow to take effect. In the first year, just 2,500 descendants applied compared to the 500,000 expected. But gradually, the number of applications picked up, turning into a deluge as the October 1 deadline approached.\nPedro Garrido, the head of Registries and Notaries, who is responsible for the application of the law in the Justice Ministry, says he would have been in favor of extending the term dictated by the law for a finite period. But this is not possible. The government already postponed the deadline by one year in 2018, and would need to change the law to do so again. This could not happen at the moment given that the Spanish parliament was dissolved when a general election was called for November 10.\nDiscounting the actual trip to Spain for the notary, the cost of Spanish nationality for a Sephardic Jew is around \u20ac500, which covers the notary, the exams and fees. But some law firms are charging as much as \u20ac5,000, turning Spanish citizenship for Sephardic Jews into a lucrative business.\nThe Justice Ministry fears that a number of fake associations could surface hoping to sell certificates authenticating Sephardic origins. Consequently, it warned notaries last February to take care with validating documents that were not from the Federation of Jewish Communities in Spain.\nInstead, Garrido send out a missive letting potential applicants know that any paperwork sent in before October 1 would be admitted, even if certain documents were lacking. Applicants just need to present a document from the Federation of Jewish Communities of Spain confirming the application for the certificate of Sephardic origin, and another document from the Cervantes Institute confirming they had signed up for a Spanish language and culture test. The applicants will have a year to hand in any missing paperwork.\nGiven the current lack of resources, it takes an average of a year to process an application, according to Garrido. Of the 60,000-odd applications submitted before August 31, only 26,290 have reached the Justice Ministry. This is due to the fact that each applicant is required to appear before a notary in Spain, who certifies whether or not they are of Sephardic origin.\nGarrido agrees that such a trip involves a sacrifice on behalf of the applicant but he views it as a reasonable condition for obtaining Spanish citizenship. Those with health problems are exempt from making the journey and those aged over 70 are not required to take the test. \u201cThere are seniors who will never set foot in Spain; they want nationality for sentimental reasons,\u201d he says.\nGetting an EU passport is another motive. The crisis in Venezuela, for example, has boosted applications from that country; 32% of the Sephardic Jews who have already been accepted as Spanish citizens are Venezuelan and a quarter of those whose applications are still being processed.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/02/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
