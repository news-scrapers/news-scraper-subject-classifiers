But he and the other six secessionist leaders who fled Spain to avoid arrest have been indirectly affected by today\u2019s sentence.\nThe Supreme Court judge who was in charge of investigating the case has today called for European and international arrest warrants against Puigdemont to be reactivated, so that he can be brought back to Spain to face trial for the offenses of sedition and misuse of public funds. For now, only the warrants for Puigdemont\u2019s detention have been reactivated, with the rest to be studied in the coming days.\nJudge Pablo Llarena withdrew an arrest warrant against the former Catalan premier, who is currently living in Belgium, after the German authorities refused to hand him over to Spain to face rebellion charges based on his involvement in the October 2017 referendum on secession from Spain and subsequent unilateral declaration of independence. Since then, the Supreme Court has only maintained a domestic arrest warrant for all of those who fled the country in 2017, meaning that they would be detained as soon as they set foot on Spanish soil.\nThe Supreme Court judge is hopeful that in the wake of today\u2019s ruling \u2013 which has found nine of the jailed Catalan secession leaders guilty of sedition, handing them down jail terms ranging from nine to 13 years \u2013 the countries where the politicians fled to will reconsider handing them over to Spain. Puigdemont and former regional ministers Toni Com\u00edn, Meritxell Serret and Llu\u00eds Puig are all in Belgium; former minister Clara Ponsat\u00ed is in Scotland, while ex-general secretary of the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) Marta Rovira and the ex-parliamentary leader of the anti-capitalist CUP, Anna Gabriel, are both in Switzerland.\nDespite the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the case, the Spanish justice system will not have an easy time convincing their Belgian counterparts to extradite Puigdemont to face sedition charges. As well as the fact that the offense has no clear equivalent in practically any other European criminal code, the strategy adopted by Judge Llarena has already run into difficulties in Belgium and Germany, given that the courts in those countries did not agree with the Spanish justice system\u2019s take on the actions of the former regional premier.\nGiven that Puigdemont is currently residing in Waterloo, the Spanish judges will once more have to convince their Belgian counterparts that he should be handed over. But the courts in Belgium rejected the European arrest warrants against the other Catalan independence leaders residing in that country back in May, prompting Judge Llarena to withdraw all such orders against the politicians who fled Spain until the Supreme Court ruling arrived. Even with the ruling, however, the path ahead for the Spanish judges will not be easy.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/14/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
