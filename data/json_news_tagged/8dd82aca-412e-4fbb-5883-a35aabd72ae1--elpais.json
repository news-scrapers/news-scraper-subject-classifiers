This newspaper has seen floor plans from September 2003 that clearly state: \u201cArchitect: Roc\u00edo Monasterio.\u201d\nIv\u00e1n and Roc\u00edo nearly destroyed my life\nAmaya P.S., loft owner\nYet Monasterio completed her end-of-the-year project in October 2009, as shown by the library records of Madrid\u2019s Polytechnic University, where she obtained her degree. Two months later, on December 21, 2009, she registered with COAM, the official architects\u2019 association of Madrid.\nThe president of Vox\u2019s Madrid branch has declined to answer questions, either personally or through a spokesperson, regarding her studies. On Monday, she gave a news conference at which she claimed that \u201cright now I cannot recollect when I was or wasn\u2019t an architect.\u201d\nBetween 2007 and 2008, Monasterio and her husband Iv\u00e1n Espinosa de los Monteros, a real estate developer who is also a regional Vox leader, built eight lofts on the site of a former plastics factory in downtown Madrid without a building license, according to city documents that this newspaper has seen. \u201cThere are no records of any building license being processed on those dates,\u201d confirmed a spokesperson at the Madrid department of city planning.\nThe couple later sold some of these lofts as housing, even though they were built on a site zoned as non-residential. For nearly a year they lived in one of the ground-floor lofts with the two children they had at the time, according to some of the building residents, although Monasterio and Espinosa de los Monteros have since denied it.\nThe couple said through a spokesperson that \u201ceverything was done respecting the law\u201d and that they sold the lofts as commercial properties. \u201cWhat the buyers did with them later is their own business.\u201d\nBut an email sent out by Espinosa de los Monteros to other property owners in the building in September 2008 talked about creating an owners\u2019 association, \u201cnow that we are all more or less settled in.\u201d On paper, the building continues to be a factory, even though people have been living in it since 2008.\n\u201cHe told us that the certificate of occupancy was being processed, but one day I went down to the city department and it hadn\u2019t even been requested. He kept talking in circles until he moved away and stopped answering his emails,\u201d says one building resident.\nI cannot recollect when I was or wasn\u2019t an architect\nLeader of Vox\u2019s Madrid branch, Roc\u00edo Monasterio\nThis newspaper and the Spanish news site El Diario have uncovered similar cases on Villafranca, San Marcos and Amalia streets.\nIn 2004, the couple mediated in the sale of three lofts built on industrial land that once housed a baking factory on Villafranca street. The buyers, who paid half a million euros each, were eventually evicted by city authorities. They say Monasterio and Espinosa de los Heros had promised to use their contacts to get the paperwork in order, but the license applications were never even filed.\nIn 2006, a woman named Amaya P. S. bought an auto repair shop on Amalia street and built a loft for which she paid \u20ac475,000. She says the couple told her that the industrial property could be rezoned as fit for residential use and that they had contacts in city government that would make the process easier. But the license never arrived. Ten years later, weary of all the legal troubles and the problems with noise and damp, she sold it for \u20ac177,000. \u201cIv\u00e1n and Roc\u00edo nearly destroyed my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t happen to anybody else.\u201d\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/30/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
