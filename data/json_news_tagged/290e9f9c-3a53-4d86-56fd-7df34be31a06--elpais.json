In an interview on the Ana Rosa show on the free-to-air television channel Telecinco, S\u00e1nchez said the results of the November 10 general election will \u201cbreak the deadlock and allow Spain to move forward.\u201d\nThis statement echoes comments made by the leader of the Socialist Party (PSOE) at the weekend, when he promised that, if he were re-elected, December and January would be \u201cworking months.\u201d He said that a spending ceiling would be set by January in order to \u201capprove a new budget plan by March.\u201d\nPedro S\u00e1nchez wants to have new budget plans approved by March\nSpain has been dogged by political deadlock since the inconclusive results of the April 28 general election, when the Socialists won the highest number of seats in Congress but fell short of an absolute majority. Despite months of negotiations, S\u00e1nchez was unable to secure enough support to be sworn back into office as prime minister at an investiture vote. The biggest stumbling block was with the anti-austerity party Unidas Podemos, which said it would only vote for S\u00e1nchez if the PSOE agreed to form a coalition government with the party. The Socialist leader rejected this demand and a repeat general election was called for November 10.\nIn the interview on Wednesday, S\u00e1nchez said that Portugal is the role model to follow. \u201cThere the Socialist Party has won. And given that there is no alternative, neither from the left or the right, the rest of the political forces are going to allow for there to be a government,\u201d he said.\nS\u00e1nchez added that he wants Spain to have a \u201cprogressive\u201d and \u201cstable\u201d government after November 10, one that does not depend on \u201cpro-independence forces,\u201d in reference to Catalan separatist parties and Basque nationalist groups.\nAccording to S\u00e1nchez, the three biggest challenges facing Spain are \u201cthe [Catalan] independence drive, Brexit and the economic slowdown.\u201d In the interview with Telecinco, the caretaker prime minister added that Spain is facing multiple \u201cchallenges\u201d including \u201cguaranteeing decent work, the ecological transition, equality between men and women, the fight against social exclusion and creating strong social harmony thanks to the statues of regional powers.\u201d\nOn the future of a possible Socialist executive, S\u00e1nchez said he would like the same ministers to continue in their positions \u2013 Nadia Calvi\u00f1o as economy minister, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero as finance minister; Pedro Duque as science minister; Margarita Robles as defense minister; and Fernando Grande-Marlaska as interior minister.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/09/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
