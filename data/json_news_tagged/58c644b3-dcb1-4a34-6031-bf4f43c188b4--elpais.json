Those strikes are scheduled for September 1, 2, 6, 8, 13, 15, 20, 22, 27 and 29, while the pilots will be walking out on September 19, 20, 22, 27 and 29.\nThe Irish airline\u2019s plans could see more than 100 pilots lose their jobs\nSpain\u2019s Public Works Ministry has already set minimum service levels for the first cabin crew strike days, protecting all of the flights to the Canary and Balearic Islands, 60% of the flights within the peninsula and to international destinations where the flight time is five hours or above, and 35% of flights within the peninsula with a flight time below five hours, according to the USO labor union.\nThe unions that have called these strikes have rejected these minimum service levels, on the basis that they are abusive, and have announced that they will stage protests outside the Labor and Public Works ministries on September 2 and 6.\nThe SEPLA union this morning filed a mediation request with the SIMA governmental arbitration service, as is legally required in such labor conflicts. The talks will take place in the coming days, and should a solution not be found, an official strike will be called. However, as was the case with the cabin crew, Ryanair is not expected to reach a compromise during the mediation, meaning the strikes will almost definitely go ahead.\nWe hope that the company reconsiders its decision, which is not supported by any economic motivations\u00a0\nSEPLA union representatives\nThe Ryanair pilots and their union argue that the planned closure of the Spanish bases are not based on any legal nor economic arguments. \u201cWe hope that the company reconsiders its decision, which is not supported by any economic motivations given that Ryanair continues to announce profits year after year,\u201d SEPLA representatives said.\nSEPLA is also arguing that Ryanair has announced the closures \u201cwithout carrying out the obligatory legal procedure to carry out a collective dismissal.\u201d The closure of the Tenerife South, Las Palmas, Lanzarote, Girona and Faro bases in January 2020 could affect more than 1.4 million seats scheduled for the first quarter of the year, according to a report from the consultancy Mabrian Technologies, in collaboration with Interface Tourism Spain.\nDespite this, Ryanair is yet to announce the effect that the stoppages will have and if they will affect the scheduling of flights.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/28/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
