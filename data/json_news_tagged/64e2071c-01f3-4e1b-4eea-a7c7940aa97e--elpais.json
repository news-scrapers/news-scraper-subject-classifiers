The Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic platform counted on 338,000 followers on its main channel in messaging service Telegram.\nInstructions sent from Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic have been closely followed by demonstrators this week, sending, for example, 25,000 people to El Prat airport in Barcelona on Monday, where protests caused widespread disruption including the cancellation of more than 100 flights and skirmishes with the police.\nGarc\u00eda-Castll\u00f3n is in charge of a judicial probe nicknamed Operation Judas, which is investigating terrorism allegations against members of the so-called Committees to Defend the Republic (CDR), a group that has carried out a number of disruptive actions in recent years to further the pro-independence cause. But judicial sources confirmed that the order for the closure of the Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic websites and accounts is not related to this operation, which saw a number of arrests on September 23.\nThe Civil Guard managed to close down some of the websites that were hosted in Spain, but others immediately sprung up on foreign servers. \u201cWe can only block access from Spain, if the domains are outside of Spain we cannot block them immediately,\u201d said sources from the public prosecutor.\nThe Civil Guard managed to close down some of the websites that were hosted in Spain, but others immediately sprung up on foreign servers\nTsunami Democr\u00e0tic was activated on September 2 with the public support of the Catalan regional premier Quim Torra, his deputy premier Pere Aragon\u00e8s, and the speaker of the regional parliament, Roger Torrent.
