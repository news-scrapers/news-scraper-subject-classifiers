He reads, speaks and enjoys both Spanish and English, like many other citizens of Gibraltar. His real passion, though, is the work of Spanish poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, which he reads out to school children on both sides of the border separating Spain from the British overseas territory.\nMy mother says she thinks in Spanish, but I think in English\nJade Romero, 17\nChildren in Gibraltar are losing their interest in Spanish and \u201cFacebook is to blame,\u201d says Guy, noting that kids no longer spend as much time playing on the streets as they used to. \u201cChildren haven\u2019t been using Spanish for a long time now,\u201d confirms Olivero, the retired owner of a bar on Casemates Square.\nSpanish never disappeared from Gibraltar. On the streets, it remained the main language even after the territory was captured by Anglo-Dutch forces and ceded to Britain in 1713. The economy flourished, and those who saw in it a chance to make their fortunes \u2013 Genoese, Maltese, Jewish and Spanish entrepreneurs \u2013 agreed that communication would be easier for everyone in Spanish.\n\u201cIf the Gibraltar Chronicle, the newspaper of record, had a circulation of 500 in 1890, El Calpense and El Anunciador, its direct competitors in Spanish, sold by the thousands,\u201d explains Lionel Cipollina, a linguist and the outgoing president of the Cross-Frontier Group, a collective of business and trade unions from both sides of the border.\nCipollina is one of the first people to have sounded the alarm about the fact that young Gibraltarians are using Spanish less and less these days. He also notes that after every affront to Gibraltar\u2019s sovereignty \u2013 the overseas territory and the surrounding waters are the subject of an ongoing dispute between British and Spanish authorities \u2013 there is a local reaction favoring English over Spanish.\nThis is a language that is part of Gibraltar\u2019s identity\nPie S\u00e1nchez, Spanish teacher\n\u201cThe language has become politicized. Many politicians see it as a bad thing for Spanish to be lost, but they dare not launch policies that could be seen as going against English,\u201d he adds. \u201cGibraltar wants to keep being bilingual, but even if the political will is there, we\u2019re coming late to this problem.\u201d\nJade, Ashlyn and other girls at Gibraltar\u2019s Westside School say their grandparents chide them for speaking to them in English. \u201cMy grandmother asks me to speak to her in Spanish, so the language won\u2019t get lost, but among ourselves we always speak in English,\u201d says Jade Romero, 17. \u201cMy mother says she thinks in Spanish, but I think in English.\u201d\nPie S\u00e1nchez, a native of Gibraltar and head of the Spanish department at Westside School, blames the loss of Spanish on satellite TV and social media. \u201cPeople used to watch [Spanish TV channels] Canal Sur or La 1. To me, it will always be Pipi Calzaslargas, not Pippi Longstocking, and La abeja Maya, not Maya the Bee. But Instagram, Twitter and Facebook use the English versions.\u201d\nStudents in Gibraltar take two hours a week of Spanish from the ages of 12 to 16. This has been expanded in other stages of compulsory education. \u201cThe government has realized that Spanish is being spoken infrequently and poorly,\u201d says S\u00e1nchez. \u201cYet this is a language that is part of Gibraltar\u2019s identity.\u201d\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/14/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
