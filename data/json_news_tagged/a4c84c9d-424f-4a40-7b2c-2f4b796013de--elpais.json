Omar Ayuso and Ar\u00f3n Piper owe this to \u00c9lite (or, Elite), the Netflix-produced series that has become a global phenomenon, and whose second season was released on the streaming platform earlier this month. Their worldwide fame has seen them end up with more online followers than there are residents in their home city of Madrid.\nThe show follows three working-class friends \u2013 Samuel, Christian and Nadia \u2013 who secure scholarships to an exclusive private school. Omar Ayuso plays Omar, who is the secretly-gay brother of Nadia. In the first season, he begins a relationship with Ander, played by Ar\u00f3n Piper, and who is the son of the school\u2019s principal.\nOmar is 19 years old, Ar\u00f3n is 22. Fans don\u2019t just love their on-screen relationship but their off-screen friendship too. \u201cKissing someone I can\u2019t stand would be unbearable,\u201d says Omar. They spend more hours working together than with anyone else, but they haven\u2019t got fed up with each other yet. \u201cWe imagined that we would like our storyline, but we didn\u2019t imagine that it would cause so much of an impact,\u201d Ar\u00f3n admits, with the two still adapting to their new celebrity status. \u201cFame is a strange thing,\u201d adds Omar. But he says that his friends are what grounds him. \u201cThey anchor me. They\u2019re the most critical of me.\u201d Ar\u00f3n reiterates: \u201cMy lifelong friends have helped me a lot. They and my family are fundamental.\u201d\nThe Madrid-born Omar moved out of the family home a few months ago. \u201cI live downtown, in a shared apartment.\u201d Before that, he lived in Manzanares el Real, a town in the north of the Madrid region. Ar\u00f3n is already used to living alone. \u201cI\u2019ve been independent since I was 18, but I\u2019m still in the process of becoming an adult.\u201d Filming each season of \u00c9lite takes eight months. As soon as they wrapped on the second series, they started working on the third, and are still shooting. They share a very active WhatsApp group with the rest of the cast. \u201cIn the first season we had summer camp syndrome and we were together every weekend. Not so much now, but that\u2019s normal,\u201d they explain. \u201cOur life is not like in \u00c9lite.\u201d\nOmar is studying broadcast communications. He began his studies before working on \u00c9lite and he still attends university. \u201cI go whenever I can. Last week I managed to fit everything in and I didn\u2019t miss a day of class.\u201d But in the future he would like to be on the other side of the camera. \u201cI have always wanted to be an actor, but after watching\u00a0Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s Bad Education I discovered cinema from the director\u2019s point of view. Since then I\u2019ve wanted to create, direct and tell my stories.\u201d He writes non-stop. \u201cI really enjoy doing it, but then I read it at the end and think it\u2019s worthless.\u201d Ar\u00f3n played the son of the actress Maribel Verd\u00fa in Gracia Querejeta\u2019s film 15 Years and One Day. At 14 years of age he was not only the protagonist of the film but he also wrote the rap song at the end of the movie, which was nominated for a Goya award \u2013 Spain\u2019s equivalent of the Oscars. \u201cIn addition to wanting to be an actor, as a child I started composing, but I lack the courage to share it with others. Music is something very personal,\u201d he explains.\nIn the second season of the show there are even more parties than in the first. A year ago, the actors were also seen going from fiesta to fiesta in real life, but nowadays this happens much less often. \u201cAt the beginning I went to any event I was invited to because it was all new,\u201d says Ar\u00f3n. Omar agrees. \u201cThe same happened to me, but I then realized that I didn\u2019t like to go to certain types of parties.\u201d They opt not to say where they like to go, so they can continue to do so undisturbed. \u201cI am completely nocturnal. I really like the nighttime, it\u2019s when my brain is active,\u201d admits Ar\u00f3n. \u201cI prefer the daytime, but the night is great too. Nights in Madrid especially,\u201d Omar says.\nThe fictional series, which is directed by Dani de la Orden and Ram\u00f3n Salazar, is set in an undetermined place. \u201cMadrid isn\u2019t spoken about but is seen.\u201d In the second season it is easy to identify the outside of the nightclub that the characters go to \u2013 formerly Pach\u00e1, now Teatro Barcel\u00f3 \u2013 as well as the Metropolis Building and Gran V\u00eda, as seen from the rooftop of The Principal Hotel. The exterior scenes of their fictional school, Las Encinas, are shot at the European University of Madrid, in Villaviciosa de Od\u00f3n. All interiors (classes, changing rooms and others) are filmed on a set. The reservoir that\u2019s shown repeatedly in the first season is Los Arroyos, in El Escorial. The fictional municipality where part of the action takes place, San Esteban, is shot in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Collado Villalba and Guadarrama, where there\u2019s the fruit shop that Omar runs. \u201cFilming in the center of Madrid would complicate everything,\u201d they agree.\nContrary to what one might think, the boys do not spend long hours in the gym. \u201cI\u2019m stick-thin \u2013 I haven\u2019t been to the gym in four or five months,\u201d admits Ar\u00f3n. The same goes for Omar. \u201cI joined the gym in September of last year. and I\u2019ve been twice.\u201d Omar has a tattoo on his hand of drawings by Ricardo Cavolo. \u201cI took several of his drawings to a tattoo artist. He took a flame from one, an eye from another and the tear from another. He put it together and tattooed it.\u201d He also has an olive crown on his arm, the title of a song by Blondie (Heart of Glass) on his chest and a 19 on his hand. Ar\u00f3n also has several tattoos scattered around his body. \u201cSome have more meaning, others are more for aesthetics.\u201d Among them, an M stands out. \u201cIt\u2019s for my father and my mother. It\u2019s the initial of their names.\u201d He also has a crying heart. \u201cIt symbolizes how much crying has helped me in life.\u201d\nFans write to them from all countries and in all languages. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. They write to us more from Italy, Brazil, Argentina or Mexico than from Spain...\u201d There are \u00c9lite fans who you wouldn\u2019t expect, even ones that the boys find it hard to believe, such as \u201cFrank Ocean!\u201d And he\u2019s not the only one: Ricky Martin, soccer stars such as Neymar and Marcelo, and many actors and directors, including Carlos Vermut, have shared their enthusiasm for the show. \u201cWe never imagined anything like this!\u201d\nWhile they continue with \u00c9lite, the two actors are dreaming about their future. \u201cI would love for [Spanish director] Fernando Franco to call me to go with [actress] Marian \u00c1lvarez to shoot a movie in a lost village of Asturias,\u201d says\u00a0Omar. And aside from that, \u201cit would be a dream to work with [American director] Ryan Murphy or [Italian director] Paolo Sorrentino.\u201d Ar\u00f3n prefers not to name names. \u201cI really like the films made in Spain, but the ones I like the most don\u2019t always make it to the billboards. Plus, I would love to make movies in France, Germany or the United Kingdom. I don\u2019t have Hollywood as a goal.\u201d\nEnglish version by Alicia Kember.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/17/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
