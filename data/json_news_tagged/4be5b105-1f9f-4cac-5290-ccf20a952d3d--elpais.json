The Spanish government has urgently passed legislation in order to protect the rights of the 365,967 Britons who are officially resident in the country, but is yet to see similar mechanisms put in place in the United Kingdom for the Spaniards who have made that country their home. The caretaker foreign minister, Josep Borrell, has already conveyed this concern to the British government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and has warned that, if there is no equivalent move from the UK as the country leaves the European Union, the Spanish framework for British residents will decline.\nReciprocity is necessary. And reciprocity cannot be guaranteed in half-measures \u2013 it is either there, or it isn\u2019t\nLuis Marco Aguiriano, Spain\u2019s secretary of state for the EU\nThe future of more than half a million people \u2013 the 365,967 Britons who officially live in Spain and the 180,000 Spaniards who reside in the United Kingdom \u2013 will depend on the way that the divorce between London and Brussels is consummated. Both the governments of caretaker Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez of the Socialist Party (PSOE) and of Boris Johnson of the Conservative Party have said that they want to preserve the rights of this collective, but the formulas used to do so differ. The United Kingdom has put in place a general scheme for all European Union citizens \u2013 Spaniards among them \u2013 that, with some nuances, freezes the range of rights that they currently enjoy under the rules of the European Union. The mechanism consists of two categories: \u201csettled status,\u201d with very generous conditions, and so-called \u201cpre-settled status,\u201d which carries with it fewer rights. The official figures from the UK show a fall in the proportion of citizens who fall into the former category. In April of this year, when the system officially began, 66% of applicants received settled status. Today the percentage has fallen to 57%.\nSpain has opted for a different route. In March, the government approved a law by royal decree that went into great detail to cover a potential \u201chard Brexit\u201d \u2013 i.e. the UK crashing out of the bloc without a deal. This legislation covers nearly all of the facets of daily life for citizens, including the recognition of university degrees and driving licenses, as well as healthcare coverage and work permits. It also guarantees, with some limitations, the continuance of the activity of British companies that are operating in Spain.\nThe UK\u2019s current Brexit minister, Steve Barclay, met last week in Madrid with Spain\u2019s caretaker Foreign Minister Josep Borrell. The rights of citizens, one of the most symbolic elements of Brexit, were a key part of the debate. Barclay expressed his gratitude for the law that had been approved by Spain, which is the country of choice for the majority of Britons who opt to live in the EU. But Borrell warned the minister that these advantageous conditions will only be maintained if they are reciprocal, a standpoint about which the British delegation requested clarifications.\n\u201cWe have told them that our royal decree will ensure that everything remains the same in the case of a no-deal Brexit,\u201d said Luis Marco Aguiriano, Spain\u2019s secretary of state for the EU, and who took part in the meeting with the British minister last Thursday. Speaking to EL PA\u00cdS via telephone, he added: \u201cBut for that, reciprocity is necessary. And reciprocity cannot be guaranteed in half-measures \u2013 it is either there, or it isn\u2019t.\u201d\nIn order to clarify all of the small print, both sides will be meeting again in the first week of October\nFrom the start, the royal decree includes that conditionality. Article two of the legislation stipulates that if, within two months, the British authorities do not grant \u201creciprocal treatment\u201d to Spanish citizens and companies, \u201cthe measures covered [by the legal text] will be suspended.\u201d Aguiriano pointed to this requirement and warned that the UK has not currently covered it in law.\nIn response, the British authorities have said that their scheme to extend the rights of EU citizens who are already living in the country guarantees the conditions that are covered by the Spanish decree. The plan from London includes the right to work, to use the healthcare system, to have access to education, to receive benefits such as pensions and to spend time outside of the UK, albeit with a limit of five years, after which \u201csettled status\u201d would be lost. Diplomatic sources argue that exact matches cannot be sought between the two texts, but they add that the requisites required by the Spanish government have been met. \u201cAlthough there may be some elements that will require further development, for our part we consider it to have been met,\u201d British sources argue.\nIn order to clarify all of the small print, both sides will be meeting again in the first week of October. On this occasion, political representatives will not attend, but rather the heads of more technical levels. The aim is to clear up as much as possible the uncertainty over Brexit, which is currently due to take place on October 31. For now there are no guarantees that the exit will take place with a deal between London and Brussels.\nAside from the coverage that it offers, the British scheme to obtain permanent residency after Brexit is not automatic. A total of 86,400 Spaniards have applied for this protected status since August 31, according to data from the British government. That accounts for nearly 7% of all the European requests, which makes Spanish residents the fifth-most-numerous collective. The Foreign Affairs Ministry calculates that of this group, around 70,000 have already secured settled status, a high percentage (81%), but not exhaustive.\nSpain, the United Kingdom and the authorities of Gibraltar say that they count on a safety net that will protect citizens who cross the border every day between Spain and the British Overseas Territory after Brexit. But the legal means to guarantee this freedom of movement are loose and, in some cases, of uncertain application. The main guarantee for continuity in the lives of cross-border workers \u2013 approximately 9,000 Spaniards \u2013 is the memorandum of understanding signed by the United Kingdom and Spain in November 2018. The text presents an unavoidable weak point: it includes rights contained in the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, which has been rejected by the British parliament on a series of occasions and by the government of Boris Johnson.\nThe memorandum is limited to guaranteeing the \u201ccorrect application of the provisions\u201d contained in the protocol on Gibraltar included in that withdrawal agreement agreed on by EU governments with former Prime Minister Theresa May, but that was later rejected by members of parliament in the House of Commons. The EU protocol expressly covers the rights of \u201ccross-border workers who reside in Gibraltar or in Spain, in particular in the territory of the municipalities that constitute the Association of Municipalities in Campo de Gibraltar.\u201d\nBut the options for the survival of the general withdrawal text within which that Gibraltar protocol is contained are very scarce, although in recent days the European Commission has been more optimistic with respect to a deal with London. Spanish, British and Gibraltarian sources consulted by EL PA\u00cdS have played down the importance of that legal obstacle and insist on the will to preserve the content of what has been agreed, beyond the formula that needs to be employed.\nThe third text that regulates flows with Gibraltar after Brexit is the Spanish royal decree covering a hard Brexit. The legislation provides for rights such as access to healthcare and education for Gibraltarians who could need them in Spain. It also guarantees financial and transport services. This framework will only come into force should the UK crash out of the EU with no deal.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/23/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
