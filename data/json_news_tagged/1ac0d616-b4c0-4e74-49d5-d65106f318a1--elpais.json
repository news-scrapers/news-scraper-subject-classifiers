She\u2019s one of the partners at Bodegas Lo M\u00e1ximo, a legendary venue in the vibrant Madrid neighborhood of Lavapi\u00e9s, just south of the city center. She\u2019s been running the bar for nearly two decades, but, like the lovers about which she is gently singing into the microphone, it is about to disappear. A British investment fund has purchased the building, located at number 6 San Carlos street. In February, when their rental agreement comes to an end, she\u2019ll have to go and look for a new line of work.\nJust two residents managed to hold onto their apartments, having purchased them before this mass sell-off\nThe same will happen to the rest of the residents in the building. Some will be leaving soon. Others have a bit more of a margin. But none of them will be able to extend their contracts. The company, Muflina Investment \u2013 along with a small stake owned by two sister companies, Gunile Investment and Pinarcam Vivienda, which have the same headquarters and director, Kevin Jeremiah Cahill \u2013 has been the owner of 27 of the 29 available properties since March. Just two residents managed to hold onto their apartments, having purchased them before this mass sell-off. And while the exodus from the building takes place, the vulture fund has hired permanent guards to avoid squatters from occupying the properties. The company in charge of this task is Urbanox, a firm that specializes in private security.\nTwo men work 12-hour shifts, stopping anyone without a key from entering, or anyone who hasn\u2019t been buzzed in by a resident via the intercom. One of the guards explains that the measures are merely meant as a \u201cdeterrent.\u201d \u201cWe only focus on who is coming in, and we are watching in case someone is stealing the electricity or getting into one of the apartments,\u201d says the employee, who opts not to give his name or age. \u201cIf we see something strange, first we tell the police,\u201d he adds. \u201cThen we call our company and they take care of it. We can\u2019t do anything else.\u201d\nA sign with the phone number for Urbanox is hanging on the door of the building. On the other end of the line, the supervisor explains that he can\u2019t give out any information about their work, but he does say that they will be there indefinitely. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long,\u201d he says, assuring he\u2019ll take the conversation to his superior. But there is no response.\nAccording to other neighbors, the situation right now is \u201ccalm,\u201d and they don\u2019t want to kick the hornets\u2019 nest\nThe residents have got used to this unexpected presence. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal,\u201d complains A. M. M., 47, about her new private concierges. She has a few more months left on her rental contract, and explains how, in March, a \u201crepresentative\u201d from a company called Avalon Properties \u2013 which has the same address as the other three companies involved \u2013 said that \u201cthe whole process aimed to be friendly.\u201d \u201cThey told me that they were interested in me leaving ahead of time and that they could make me an offer. I asked for it in writing and I haven\u2019t heard anything since,\u201d she says. She adds that the security guards showed up after a woman and her son started to squat in one of the apartments. \u201cThey cut off the electricity and she left,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t bother me,\u201d says Yuri, another tenant, about the watchmen. She says that she has two years left on her rental contract and that she is \u201cliving normally.\u201d \u201cWhat they have done is legal, so we can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d she says about the plight of people like her against real estate giants. The tenants in the building have not made a public statement about the purchase, nor have they formally joined Bloques en Lucha, a citizen platform in Lavapi\u00e9s that is working to raise awareness about this kind of operation with the aim of stopping the eviction of residents from the neighborhood and the rise in property prices.\nAccording to other neighbors, the situation right now is \u201ccalm,\u201d and they don\u2019t want to kick the hornets\u2019 nest. One explains that she received an official notice with the change in name of her landlord. She currently pays \u20ac540 in rent, which could go up to \u20ac900, she explains. It\u2019s a higher amount than that which is paid by another veteran resident who has been in the block for three decades and pays less than \u20ac500 a month. She is waiting to see what they offer her, but she is not optimistic. She doesn\u2019t think that any of them will be able to stay. Not unless they get to continue paying the \u20ac600 or so that they currently pay for the 60-square meter properties.\nOne of the younger residents, who requested anonymity, explains how the investment fund has proposed that he stay on one condition: that he renounce his right to be informed of how much the fund paid for the apartment. \u201cI\u2019d have the chance to find out how much it cost them,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that they are bragging about how cheap it was.\u201d\nThey came to me with kind words, but these people don\u2019t care about anyone, they only see numbers\nLocal vet Nines\nNines works at the Can Contento veterinary clinic, which is in one of the three business premises in the building at street level. She calculates that the investment fund will have paid around \u20ac3 million for the 27 properties, which includes storage rooms. It\u2019s quite a low price for the area. \u201cIt\u2019s a snip,\u201d says the 60-year-old. She knew the family that owned the building before, and thinks that they wanted to sell it off quickly and divide up the money between their six children.\nThe only thing standing in the fund\u2019s way of buying the whole building was the two apartments that had been previously sold. The owners of these apartments, who did not want to appear in this article, made up two-thirds of the ownership of the building, given that the investment fund counted as just one owner. That is why, the residents claim, the fund opted to use a number of different companies to complete the purchase. Thanks to the use of three firms, they now have the absolute majority when decisions about the block have to be made.\nThere is also talk that they are going to turn it into a hotel aimed at homosexual men, with a swimming pool and rooftop bar\n\u201cThey came to me with kind words, but these people don\u2019t care about anyone, they only see numbers,\u201d says Nines. \u201cThey\u2019re a monster without a heart or blood in its veins. You can\u2019t trust them an inch.\u201d\nHer rental conditions mean that she can\u2019t be thrown out until 2027. She\u2019s currently taking advice from a lawyer in a bid to purchase her home. She says that it is vital to fight against such funds. \u201cI don\u2019t want the neighborhood to be destroyed, for it to be lost. And it has nothing to do with your political stripes, it\u2019s justice,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, my husband is sick and I have seven years left before I retire, so I have no choice but to resist.\u201d\nShe has no idea what the intentions of the vulture fund are. \u201cThere are rumors that they want to refurbish the entrance and the apartments, to make it into something exclusive, luxury. There is also talk that they are going to turn it into a hotel aimed at homosexual men, with a swimming pool and a rooftop bar,\u201d she whispers.\nNone of the residents knows exactly what the future holds in store for this building. But everyone is waiting anxiously for news. Even Nines\u2019 clients, who ask \u201cHow long do you have left?\u201d, as the sounds of boleros drift in the air from the bar next door.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "07/29/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
