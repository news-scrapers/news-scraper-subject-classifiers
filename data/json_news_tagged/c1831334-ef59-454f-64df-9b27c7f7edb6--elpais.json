The woman turned to the security guard, who reprehended the thief for his action. At that point, the assailant took out a knife and attacked both of them.\nSeeing police on the streets bothers Ada Colau\nLorena Rold\u00e1n, Ciudadanos\nThe Catalan police have opened an investigation into the incident, which took place at around 3am inside a nightclub called Smar. The suspect fled the scene and has not yet been identified or located.\nBoth stab victims were taken by ambulance to Hospital del Mar, where the woman died from a chest wound.\nThis is the latest case to make headlines after a month of August marked by a spike in crime in the Catalan capital. The mayor, Ada Colau, has blamed the regional government, while opposition parties in the city council say it is due to Colau\u2019s inefficient policies.\nEP\nLocal authorities have admitted that the city is experiencing \u201ca security crisis,\u201d and the US Embassy recently issued a security alert warning visitors to be vigilant. The police are blaming groups of organized youngsters for a lot of the street crime taking place in Barcelona.\n\u201cSeeing police on the streets bothers her,\u201d said Lorena Rold\u00e1n, head of the center-right Ciudadanos party in the Catalan parliament. Her group defends a reform of the criminal code to toughen up penalties for offenders.\nSo far this year, 13 people have met with a violent death in Barcelona, and police are still investigating the death of an elderly couple inside their home in August.\nThere were 49,300 crime reports between January and March in Barcelona, half of which were for theft. But the biggest cause for concern is the rise in violent theft (28%), representing around 40 cases a day.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/04/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
