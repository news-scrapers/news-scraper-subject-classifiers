The founder of the telecoms company ONO was forced to flee from the proprietor of the business in the south of the country, after he attacked Gald\u00f3n and one of his children. They tried to leave in their vehicle but were stunned to see the man jump onto the hood of the car and smash the windshield. The assailant managed to stay put as the car drove for several kilometers.\nThe incident took place on August 15 in Porto Palermo, a popular area with tourists. Video of what happened has been broadcast by an Albanian television station, and shows not only the man trying to break through the windshield, but also the moment when he tries to open the driver\u2019s door. At that moment, the family, accompanied by a guide and a driver, manages to make their escape.\nThe attack not only ended up requiring the assistance of the Spanish Embassy in Tirana, the capital of Albania, but also the mediation of the Albanian authorities, according to Spanish diplomatic sources. The same sources did not reveal the origin of the disagreement that prompted the restaurant owner to attack the Gald\u00f3n family.\nThe country\u2019s tourism minister, Blendi Klosi, received the family to apologize for what happened. The meeting was recorded and shared by the prime minister of the country, Edi Rama. The Spanish businessman is heard to thank the country\u2019s authorities for the treatment his family had received. \u201cOne man does not represent a whole country,\u201d he tells the minister in the recording. \u201cYou should be proud of the country you have.\u201d\n\n The video shared by the Albanian prime minister of the Gald\u00f3n family meeting with the country\u2019s tourism minister.\nBoth Gald\u00f3n and one of his children required medical treatment for minor injuries they suffered during the incident. After receiving the apologies, the family continued with their vacation.\nPrime Minister Rama also made a statement about what had happened. \u201cThe barbarian who struck our Spanish friends has violated the sacred code of Albanian hospitality and has brought shame upon us all,\u201d he wrote via his Facebook page. \u201cHospitality is the most important weapon of Albanian tourism. The assault that took place last night [in reference to August 15] is a stain that shames us all and should not be forgotten. I trust that this barbarian will not escape justice.\u201d\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/20/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
