Quite the opposite, it has made the situation worse, proving the futility of returning to the polls in search of an arithmetic solution to a problem that was, and continues to be, of a different nature. Shifting the logic of an absolute majority from the parties to the blocs has caused serious political paralysis and, simultaneously, polarized and radicalized Spanish public life. The most tangible result has been the alarming rise of the far right.\nPopular Party leader Pablo Casado has emerged from this latest election in an ambivalent position\nThe Socialist Party (PSOE) candidate, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, continues to be the only leader in a position to forge a majority, even though he did not retain the number of seats he won in April. Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera\u2019s refusal to reach any deals with the left condemned the viability of the previous political term from the start. It would have been much better for the PSOE to have recognized this early on, instead of pushing the deadlines in search of an electoral gain that ultimately escaped it.\nAn alliance with Unidas Podemos did not guarantee a stable parliamentary majority, while having to depend on the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) for government action would have been reckless, which S\u00e1nchez himself recognized in the end. It is true that the repeat election has weakened Unidas Podemos in the struggle to define the politics of the left, giving the Socialist Party a wider margin to reject the coalition government that Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias has insistently demanded. But the process has come at a cost to S\u00e1nchez.\nPopular Party (PP) leader Pablo Casado has emerged from this latest election in an ambivalent position. The PP\u2019s improved results offer him an internal reprieve but at the same time showcase the limitations of his leadership. The relative stagnation of the PP under Casado can be partly explained by the group\u2019s effort to juggle two contradictory objectives \u2013 toning down its rhetoric to attract center voters, while simultaneously accepting the political agenda of the far right, marked by ultranationalism, xenophobia and nostalgia for the Franco regime.\nBut it is one thing to accommodate Vox during the campaign, and quite another to rely on their support by replicating the governing formulas reached in Andalusia and in other regions and cities of Spain. Casado\u2019s attitude toward Vox will determine whether the spiral of radicalization initiated by Catalan separatism gets tempered, or whether it continues to grow, fueled by both sides.\nThe severe punishment that Ciudadanos has received at the polls does not make up for the damage that its strategy has inflicted on the political system\nNone of these risks would be on the table today if the most badly defeated force at Sunday\u2019s election, Ciudadanos, had agreed to negotiate with the Socialist Party back when it had the chance, instead of attempting to become the new leader of the political right even though the numbers did not add up. The severe punishment that Ciudadanos has received at the polls does not make up for the damage that its strategy has inflicted on the political system, destroying the center ground and opening up our institutions to a force such as Vox.\nCiudadanos\u2019 results place the potential successor of Albert Rivera, In\u00e9s Arrimadas, in a tight spot. It is to be expected that either whoever takes the helm of Ciudadanos will honor the commitment to put their representatives at the service of governability, not deadlock.\nThe results of the Sunday election bring the situation back to square one, and so, rather than focus on the party combinations that could form around the Socialist candidate \u2013 who remains the only one in a position to forge a majority \u2013 the important thing now is to explore the possibilities of a bare-bones governing program to get the new political term underway.\nBeing predisposed to negotiate the contents of such a program is thus essential in order to allow parliament to finally act on its constitutional duty to appoint a new prime minister and back government action. But it is also essential in order to restrain the outward-pushing forces that have handed a destabilizing amount of decision-making power to the political extremes. This decision-making capability should be immediately returned to the parties that are unequivocally committed to upholding the Constitution.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson and Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/11/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
