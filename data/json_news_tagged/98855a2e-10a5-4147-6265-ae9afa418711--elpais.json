At its feet, by the banks of the Tagus River, lies the old Visigothic capital \u2013 an area that has been granted BIC status \u2013 the highest legal protection, making it untouchable \u2013 four times. Yet decade after decade, apartment blocks, official buildings and roads have been going up all around it, encroaching upon the ancient city. Luxury apartments with pools and spas are currently being built on the site known as Vega Baja, which was once home to a Roman circus. Now only the stands of the circus are visible from a park and nearby streets.\nThe historical value is incalculable. Why don\u2019t they value this instead of just wanting to develop?\nArchaeologist Juan Manuel Rojas\nUnder the 1986 general town planning scheme, 1,500 apartments were allowed to be built. The new 2007 zoning plan that replaced it maintained this provision, but it was annulled by the Supreme Court in 2017, meaning the 1986 plan has legal standing. According to Toledo City Hall, two modifications were made in 2017 to authorize the construction of a new Civil Guard barracks, but not homes. Despite this, local authorities recognize that developers have vested rights in Vega Baja, which was the suburbium, or suburbs, of the Visigothic capital. Toledo\u2019s town-planning councilor, Jos\u00e9 Pablo Sabrido, asserts that\u00a0\u201cno building work will ever take place on top of the site, ever.\u201d But the citizen group does not believe him.\n\u201cIn this area, the Visigoths built the basilicas of Santa Leocadia, San Pedro and San Pablo, where at least eight Councils were held,\u201d explains Juan Manuel Rojas, the archaeologist who led part of the excavation work, now discontinued for almost a decade. \u201cIn the early 1970s, [archaeologist] Pedro de Palol found the remains of the Santa Leocadia basilica [today Cristo de la Vega basilica] and, in 2001, we documented various structures of a large construction with 1.3-meter-thick walls. Now there is a clinic there,\u201d he complains.\nAntonio Z\u00e1rate, a member of Toledo, Society, Heritage and Culture and of the Royal Toledo Foundation, is also concerned about the building activity. \u201cThe Roman circus didn\u2019t end at the park fence. They say there is nothing beyond and that\u2019s why they can build houses for rich people with views of the historic center. Just for them,\u201d he complains. \u201cRight here, where the Santa Eulalia church was, there are going to be 86 homes, another 300 where the circus was; on the other side of the Vega [Baja] they have built a boutique hotel [...] A school was built on top of the Temple of Mars. What are they doing?\u201d\nThe archeological site is currently fenced off, but multiple traffic lanes with roundabouts cross through it and it is surrounded by homes that are several stories high. The remains of Visigothic, Roman and Muslim structures can be seen in the areas that were excavated by archaeologists years ago.\n\u201cThere are few cities in Europe with such a collection of monumental structures. The historical value is incalculable. Why don\u2019t they value this instead of just wanting to develop the land?,\u201d asks Rojas. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a painting by [Spanish artist Joaqu\u00edn] Sorolla in the attic covered in dust and humidity, and not showing it. We have to think of the future generations.\u201d\nAraceli Pereda, the president of the heritage protection association Our Hispania, says they are going to demand an explanation from Toledo City Hall and from the regional government of Castilla-La Mancha for what is happening. \u201cIt was the capital of the Visigothic kingdom!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cWe not only have to protect the BIC zone, we also have to protect its surroundings, which form part of the same city [...]. They are already building five-story apartments. It\u2019s very alarming.\u201d\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/11/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
