Speaking last Thursday at the Elcano Forum on Global Terrorism, Miguel \u00c1ngel Carballo, deputy chief public prosecutor at the High Court, said that \u201cthese women have a great ability to indoctrinate others, especially minors,\u201d irrespective of whether they traveled to Syria as the wives of ISIS fighters or to join ISIS ranks.\nMany sexist sentences acquit a woman of being a jihadist from the outdated idea that women are either instruments or victims of violence\nMiguel \u00c1ngel Carballo, deputy chief public prosecutor\nThe four women \u2013 Spaniards Lubna Miludi, Yolanda Mart\u00ednez Cobos, Luna Fern\u00e1ndez Grande and Moroccan-born Loubna Fares \u2013 left Spain for Syria, and are now being held in the Al Hol and Al Roj camps in northeastern Syria, along with a total of 17 biological and adopted children. All of the women claim they followed their husbands to the conflict zone without realizing what they were getting into.\nA further 248 people \u2013 including 30 women \u2013 are estimated to have left Spain for Syria to fight for ISIS. Of this figure, 150 are Moroccan, 48 from Spain and 50 from other nationalities, according to data from Civil Guard Commander Cristina Andrey, from the Intelligence Center for Counter-Terrorism and Organized Crime (CITCO). Andrey, a specialist in jihadist terrorism, said at the forum that 133 may still be in Syria, 68 have died, and 47 have returned to Spain.\nExperts at the talks, titled Foreign fighters: The Phenomenon and The Responses, agreed that the repatriation of former ISIS fighters presents a big challenge for European countries. The lack of a legal framework for what is a relatively new situation is compounded by scant concrete results from the few existing de-radicalization and reintegration programs.\nThis has contributed to the reluctance of European Union members to repatriate their citizens from Syria \u2013 a position that is in conflict with international humanitarian law. Spain\u2019s Secretary of State Ana Botella said on the forum that most EU countries had \u201cno intention of repatriating [fighters] en masse,\u201d and would instead evaluate each situation \u201con a case by case\u201d basis. Botella said she would \u201cprefer\u201d that the fighters face court in Syria, but not be subject to the death sentence. Just weeks earlier, however, Spain\u2019s caretaker foreign affairs minister, Josep Borrell, told the European Parliament: \u201cIf they have pending cases with the justice system, we will ask for them to come here,\u201d in reference to the three Spanish ISIS women.\nThe High Court has issued international arrest warrants for terrorism activity against 70 people\nThe High Court has issued international arrest warrants for the three Spanish women in Syria for \u201cparticipating in terrorist activities before moving to Syria,\u201d according to Botella.\nIn total, the High Court has issued international arrest warrants for terrorism activity against 70 people, including 13 women, two of whom have returned to Spain, said Carballo at the forum.\n\u201cThe solution to the problem presented by these women lies in what facts can be proven, if there is no sign they were involved with jihadist activity before leaving [for Syria],\u201d said Carballo. \u201cWhy did they go, what was their intention, what did they do there?\u201d\nUnder the recent changes to Spain\u2019s criminal code, just the intention to go to a conflict zone is considered a crime but Spain\u2019s lack of jurisdiction in Syria is an issue. \u201cWe have won more cases for belonging [to a terrorist organization] than for the crime of moving [to a conflict zone],\u201d said Carballo. Indeed many sentences for the latter have been absolved by the Spanish Supreme Court, he added.\n\u201cThere have been many sexist sentences that acquit a woman of being a drug trafficker, scam artist or jihadist, based on the protective and outdated idea that women are either instruments or victims of violence, and that is not always the case,\u201d explained Carballo.\n\u201cA trained indoctrinator is able to commit attacks,\u201d and a \u201cfive-year-old boy could already be indoctrinated and be an indoctrinating factor in schools,\u201d he added.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/29/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
