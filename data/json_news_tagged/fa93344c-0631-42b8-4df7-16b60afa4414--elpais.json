Representatives from all political parties apart from Vox congregated at noon outside Madrid City Hall to pay tribute to Adaliz Villagra, a 31-year-old woman killed by her ex-partner in front of their daughters on Tuesday.\nThe mayor is not going to tell me that we must only protect those who make up the majority of the statistics\nVox spokesperson Javier Ortega Smith\nThe local Madrid branch of Vox announced on Wednesday that it would be boycotting the tribute, claiming it was a \u201cpublicity campaign for the left.\u201d But instead, Vox local councilors appeared before City Hall with their own banner with the message: \u201cViolence has no gender.\u201d The stunt angered the mayor of Madrid, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida of the conservative Popular Party (PP), who confronted Vox spokesperson Javier Ortega Smith, and insisted the far-right party support the fight against gender violence.\nIn the heated public exchange, which took place in the full view of the press, Ortega Smith responded that Vox is \u201cagainst all violence,\u201d and against \u201cgender ideology, which is what defines the left.\u201d The mayor replied that he was also against \u201cgender ideology and 8-M feminism,\u201d the latter a reference to the March 8 Women\u2019s Day demonstrations, which have seen massive support in Spain in the last two years and have involved a general strike. But the mayor added that it was \u201can indisputable fact\u201d that 20% of violent deaths in Madrid \u201ccorresponded to the killing of women.\u201d Ortega Smith, Vox\u2019s general secretary and one of the party\u2019s 24 deputies in Congress, replied: \u201cThe mayor is not going to tell me that we must only protect those who make up the majority of the statistics.\u201d\nAlmeida hit back: \u201cYou know perfectly well that I am not saying that. This is a real problem, [it is] the main cause of violent death in the city and the region of Madrid, and it demands an agreement and a consensus. I would have liked you to have at least told us that you were coming with another banner.\u201d\nSo far this year, 40 women in Spain have been killed by their current or former partners\nMadrid City Hall is governed by a coalition between the PP and center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens), thanks to the support of Vox, whose four votes were needed to achieve the 29-seat threshold for an absolute majority inside the city council. But the PP and Ciudadanos have clashed on a number of issues, including LGBTQ+ rights and gender violence.\nThe local government is trying to get all political parties in City Hall to sign a pact against gender violence, but Vox has refused to support the measure, arguing that laws covering such offenses discriminate against men. Vox instead has campaigned for the focus on gender violence to be shifted to \u201cfamily violence.\u201d\nIn the southern Spanish region of Andalusia, which is also governed by the PP and Ciudadanos thanks to Vox\u2019s support, the far-right party has used its position to push the regional government to open a hotline dedicated to victims of \u201cfamily violence,\u201d and to demand a list of the names of all government workers who deal with gender violence.\nSo far this year, 40 women in Spain have been killed by their current or former partners. The tally since 2003, when records began, is 1,015.\nThe figures on gender violence are \u201cstubbornly\u201d consistent and \u201cshow the reality of the specific violence against women that culminates in femicide.\u201d That\u2019s according to magistrate Inmaculada Montalb\u00e1n, who is also the former president of the Observatory against Domestic and Gender Violence at Spain\u0090\u2019s legal watchdog, the CGPJ.\nVox usually argues, as it did this Thursday, that the gender violence law in Spain discriminates against a part of society. \u201cThe Constitutional Court has said on a number of occasions that [the law] does not discriminate, but rather establishes measures for a situation in which women are in a position of disadvantage within the bond of marriage or similar,\u201d Montalb\u00e1n explains. \u201cAnyone who claims that there is discrimination in respect of other collectives does not understand the Criminal Code and is unaware of the workings of our judicial bodies.\u201d\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/20/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
