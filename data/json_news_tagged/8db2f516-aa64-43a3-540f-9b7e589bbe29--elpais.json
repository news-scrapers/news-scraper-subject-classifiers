Just a few hours later, he was back in Tangier, the Moroccan city that he had left behind a year and a half earlier, hidden under a truck, on his way \u201cto a better life.\u201d It was 2006 and Bilal El Meghraui was 17 years old.\nBilal is one of the few Moroccan teenagers that Spanish courts have managed to bring back to Spain after Madrid and Rabat signed a memorandum in 2003 allowing for the deportation of unaccompanied minors.\nRepatriations are used as currency by Morocco and Spain, Germany, France or Sweden\nMercedes Jim\u00e9nez, anthropologist\nHis story showcased just how badly government agencies can handle these cases. In a pioneering ruling, a judge eventually ordered authorities to bring the young man back to Spain, three years after his traumatic experience. But Bilal does not like to think back on that episode. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d he says, 13 years later.\nHe was flown back to Morocco on the grounds that it was in his own best interest, although nobody had asked him if he wanted to. Nor had any official contacted his family to make sure somebody would be there for him, despite the fact that this is a legal requirement.\n\u201cThey knocked me to the ground, they put me up against the wall, they insulted me...the police didn\u2019t explain anything to me,\u201d he recalls.\nFrom 2004 to 2017, Spain sent back around 300 minors, including at least 158 from Morocco, according to figures from the Attorney General\u2019s Office, which oversees these procedures to ensure they comply with the law.\nIt\u2019s not going to make a difference. People are going to try it again\nBilal El Meghraui\nMore than two thirds of these repatriations took place between 2004 and 2006, the year they took Bilal. After that, prosecutor reports began complaining about \u201cvery scant cooperation\u201d from the countries of origin, while admitting that there were \u201cserious deficiencies\u201d in the way these returns were being handled. There was a surge in legal complaints and more court decisions that were favorable to the underage migrants. This led to legislative changes with greater guarantees for the deportees.\nBut the initiative to send back underage immigrants has been supported by local, regional and national leaders from across the political spectrum. The latest politician to embrace the measure was Albert Batlle, Barcelona\u2019s deputy mayor for citizen safety, who does not even have powers over these policies.\nReactivating the old agreement with Morocco has been on the executive\u2019s agenda for months. In late 2018, officials from the Interior Ministry and the Office of the State Secretary for Migration intensified talks with Rabat in an effort to get Morocco to take back its underage migrants.\nNon-profits are warning that the bad practices of the past could make a comeback. \u201cI can\u2019t refuse to send back a child who wants to go back to his family. The key is that these procedures require guarantees: the minor has the right to be heard and to a lawyer who will defend his or her interests,\u201d says Lourdes Reyz\u00e1bal, of Fundaci\u00f3n Ra\u00edces.\nOnce again, Rabat holds the key. According to official figures, nearly 70% of the more than 12,000 underage immigrants living in Spain are Moroccan.\n\u201cRepatriations are used as currency by Morocco and Spain, Germany, France or Sweden,\u201d says Mercedes Jim\u00e9nez, an anthropologist who works to defend immigrant children and teens. \u201cThe primary concern is not protection, it is migratory control and the use of a criminalizing rhetoric.\u201d\nBilal waited three years for the court ruling that said that he was sent back illegally. He returned to Madrid in 2009, resumed his carpenter courses and later studied cooking. Since 2012 he has been working as a cook at one of the restaurants run by the world-famous Adri\u00e0 brothers, thanks to a project named Cocina Conciencia run by Fundaci\u00f3n Ra\u00edces.\n\u201cI suffer when I think of the way those policemen treated me, and what they did to me,\u201d says Bilal. \u201cNow I have another life. I just want to be a good cook.\u201d\nBilal does not think that sending kids back is a good solution. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to make a difference. People are going to try it again,\u201d he notes, recalling how the only thing he could think of when he found himself back in Tangier was how to climb under a truck again to go back to Algeciras in Spain. \u201cThere\u2019s no stopping that.\u201d\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "07/29/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
