That is more than five percentage points up on the share of the vote that the party led by caretaker Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez secured at the inconclusive April 28 general election.\nThe CIS poll shows that the PSOE currently counts on twice as much support as the conservative Popular Party (PP), which scored 17.1% in the survey. The PP, which was ousted from power last summer in a vote of no-confidence against then-Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, scored its worst electoral result ever at the April polls, with just 16.7% of the vote.\nThis latest survey was carried out before negotiations between Spain\u2019s main political parties failed to produce a governing deal, meaning that the country is now headed to another general election, scheduled for November 10, the fourth in as many years. At the April polls, the PSOE took the most votes, but fell short of a majority, and was expected to reach a deal with left-wing anti-austerity group Unidas Podemos. Despite months of talks, however, S\u00e1nchez and Unidas Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias were unable to hammer out an agreement.\nCenter-right party Ciudadanos (Citizens) comes out worst in the latest CIS poll compared to how it fared at the April vote. Support for the group led by Albert Rivera has dropped by three points compared to the last general election, at which it won 15.86% of the vote.\nUnidas Podemos, meanwhile, which took 14.3% of the vote in April, would now take 15.5%, according to this CIS survey.\nThe survey was also carried out before confirmation that Podemos co-founder I\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n would be running at the November 10 election with new party M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds. Errej\u00f3n left Podemos after disagreements with co-founder Iglesias, and ran in the Madrid regional elections with the party M\u00e1s Madrid. The appearance of this new group could, some commentators argue, further splinter the support for the left at the November poll.\nThe CIS poll also reveals that the percentage of people who say that politics and politicians are among the country\u2019s biggest problems has gone up by seven points in just two months, to 45.3% \u2013 the worst figure since records began in 1985.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/26/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
