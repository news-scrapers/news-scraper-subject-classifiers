And as such, Catalan ultranationalism displays the same authoritarian traits, the same obsession with identity, and the same demagogic sophistry that Abascal himself has exhibited.\nAlso like Catalan ultranationalists, who are obsessed with seeking legitimacy for their actions by equating Spain\u2019s constitutional system with various undemocratic regimes, Abascal enjoyed portraying himself as the bold champion of a movement battling against a dictatorship that only exists in his own rhetoric and fanatical thinking. It bears reminding that the only measures ever imposed in Spain without the majority backing of citizens are not those created by perverse progressives or by any alleged gender-based ideology, but by an actual political regime that functioned for decades as an incontestable dictatorship \u2013 one that Abascal and other Vox leaders have expressed a fond nostalgia for; one that sought support and inspiration from the most ferocious tyrants of the 20th century and their sinister ideologies in order to subvert the legitimate order in Spain.\nAbascal enjoyed portraying himself as the bold champion of a movement battling against a dictatorship that only exists in his own rhetoric and fanatical thinking\nAll alarms should be going off at this point after seeing a force like Vox at a campaign debate to determine the immediate political future of Spain, and after witnessing the spine-chilling ease with which its leader\u2019s xenophobic, intolerant arguments were allowed to be voiced with impunity alongside those of the other candidates.\nThis wake-up call should serve to stop the PP and Ciudadanos from incorporating into their governing majorities a political group whose principles and proposals have no room within our constitutional order. And in the case of the Socialist Party and Unidas Podemos, it should remind them of their inexcusable duty to reply to Vox\u2019s assertions and defend all the groups that were singled out by a force that cannot be considered to be like the others.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/06/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
