She will be replaced by Phil Hogan.\nMaroto notes in the letter that \u201csteel companies in the Union are in a difficult situation, to the extent that some production lines and plants are considering closure due to the shortage of demand and competition from imports.\u201d\nOnce Britain leaves the European Union, the Commission should \u201ccarry out an urgent review of safeguard measures in order to adapt to the new situation,\u201d the minister urges.\nAlthough the letter acknowledges a review that took place on September 4, and which Spain supported, the minister believes that the Brexit process makes a new review necessary, especially if the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal.\nLimiting steel imports is \u201cof great interest to Spain, given the relevance of the sector in our country and the difficulties that it has recently encountered.\u201d\nDuring Maroto\u2019s term at the industry ministry, the steel multinational Alcoa announced it was shutting down two plants in Spain. The auto industry\u2019s slowdown is also affecting national steelmakers, said the industry association UNESID last summer.\nThe Spanish steel industry produced 14.3 million tons of steel in 2018, a 0.8% drop from the previous year, according to UNESID. Spanish companies exported 8.5 million tons worth nearly \u20ac8 billion, a 0.6% rise from 2017, according to the Tax Agency.\nBut imports increased by 8.6% in terms of volume (10.8 million tons) and by 13.4% in terms of value (to \u20ac8.2 billion), which resulted in a trade balance deficit for the first time in a decade. Although the price of Spanish steel decreased, it was still nearly \u20ac200 more expensive than imported steel: \u20ac938 per ton versus \u20ac758 per ton.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/10/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
