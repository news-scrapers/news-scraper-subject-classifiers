Conan The Barbarian cost almost \u20ac19 million \u2013 the equivalent to almost \u20ac100 million today \u2013 and was the first big break for Arnold Schwarzenegger (born in Thal, Austria, 1947) who was, at that point, better known for his bodybuilding titles.\nThe Civil War almost started all over again There were tanks out in the streets!\nDirector John Milius and Arnold Schwarzenegger remembering the events of the February 23 coup attempt\nConan the Barbarian would be nothing special when compared to Schwarzenegger\u2019s other films if it were not for the fact it was shot in Spain, specifically Madrid, Segovia and Almer\u00eda, and during the 1981 Spanish coup d\u2019\u00e9tat attempt.\nBut this story starts four years before in 1977. Following the success of Star Wars, when a sequel to the fantasy film was already being planned, Hollywood realized that there was a lot of public interest in big action franchises. In this context, came the idea to make a film about Conan The Barbarian, the fictional warrior created by Robert E. Howard in 1932, with a script written by Oliver Stone.\nSchwarzenegger was offered \u20ac230,000 for the first film, \u20ac1 million for the next and close to \u20ac2 million for the third (in the end, he would only shoot two). It was an irresistible deal that would help him to fulfill a common, yet elusive dream: to get rich. The project was put on hold for a few years until the all-powerful Italian producer Dino de Laurentiis appeared. He knew shooting in Europe was cheaper and Spain, specifically, was the best place to film medieval adventures set in mountains and castles.\nIn his autobiography Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story, Schwarzenegger says that De Laurentiis didn\u2019t like him at first and even called him a Nazi (Schwarzenegger was no such thing, but his father Gustav was a member of the party, like many Austrian policemen of his time). The director of Conan the Barbarian, John Milius, responded to these insinuations, half jokingly, by buying small figures of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco and putting them on De Laurentiis\u2019 desk, shouting: \u201cI am the only Nazi here!\u201d (Milius was not a Nazi either but he was very right-wing \u2013 as well as being an incredible scriptwriter, writing some of the most famous phrases of Jaws and Apocalypse Now).\nI thought, \u2018Hey, hey, wait, I\u2019m in Madrid! Let\u2019s see its museums, its interesting architecture, and let's also try to have dinner at 11pm like the Spaniards\nArnold Schwarzenegger\nFranco wasn\u2019t the only dictator who turned the story of Conan the Barbarian into a history of political changes in Europe at the end of the 20th century. The movie was originally going to be shot in Yugoslavia, but the death of its head of state, Josip Broz Tito, brought Schwarzenegger and his team to Spain. The film would have cost \u20ac32 million in Italy and \u20ac60 million in the United States, but was just \u20ac19 million in Spain because, as Schwarzenegger explained, it was \u201can enterprising but non-unionized country.\u201d\nIn January 1981, the technical team and actors were already staying at the Villa Magna apartments in Madrid. The film would involve 1,500 extras as well as horses, camels, goats, vultures, snakes, dogs, a falcon and a leopard. It would also star a very young Jorge Sanz (one of the most prominent actors of Spanish cinema) in the role of Conan as a child.\nIn February, the shoot moved to Segovia in Castilla y Le\u00f3n, around 80 kilometers from Madrid. At 6.23pm on February 23, while the crew were recording the first scene in the city, Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Tejero and 200 members of the Civil Guard stormed the Congress of Deputies in Madrid.\n\u201cWhile we were filming this scene, there was an attempted coup by the Civil Guard,\u201d director John Milius says in the movie commentary on the 2011 Conan The Barbarian DVD. \u201cThe Civil War almost started all over again,\u201d he adds.\n\u201cI remember it perfectly,\u201d responds Schwarzenegger in the commentary. \u201cThere were tanks out in the streets!\u201d Shortly afterwards, the Civil Guard arrived in Valsain in the province of Segovia and, according to the Spanish daily ABC, filming of Conan The Barbarian was stopped for a few hours. With Spain on high alert, the authorities were not keen for a bunch of Americans with weapons, explosives and animals to be filming a few kilometers from the capital.\nIt wasn\u2019t the only problem the production team would face. The chilly February temperatures in Segovia caused the artificial blood to freeze, so it had to be mixed with vodka (which contains ethanol and prevents it from freezing at low temperatures). There was also a problem with the Spanish extras. \u201cThey took too long to die,\u201d Schwarzenegger writes in his autobiography. \u201cMilius told them again and again, \u2018When Conan stabs you, you just fall.\u2019 But they fell theatrically, got halfway up, fell down again, gasped ... I was busy killing my next opponent and I heard Milius shout to the guy behind me, \u2019You're dead! Stay down! You\u2019ve been slashed, don\u2019t move!\u201d In the end, the director offered those extras more money to stay still and act completely dead.\nAnd then there was the issue of snakes. A few real water snakes were needed for a scene, but the handler was worried that they were going to dehydrate. The only solution Milius came up with was to throw them into a pool. Which pool? The pool at the luxurious apartment complex where the team was staying. \u201cIn the United States, the Health Department or Animal Welfare Department would have been there in two seconds,\u201d Schwarzenegger writes in his autobiography. \u201cBut in Spain this kind of thing was routine,\u201d he adds.\nIt was a wonderful period of my life and the film did a lot for my career\nArnold Schwarzenegger\nBut that permissive and somewhat primitive Spain described by Schwarzenegger is not entirely accurate: environmentalists complained that the film shoot was affecting the marshes, and animal rights advocates complained that dogs, camels and horses were abused during the filming.\nWhile filming Conan The Barbarian, Schwarzenegger also had time to discover Madrid. \u201cI thought, \u2018Hey, hey, wait, I\u2019m in Madrid! Let\u2019s see its museums, its interesting architecture, let\u2019s discover its buildings and streets. Let\u2019s try some restaurants that everybody talks about. And let\u2019s also try to have dinner at 11pm like the Spaniards.\u201d\nConan The Barbarian was an instant success. A sequel \u2013 Conan The Destroyer \u2013 would be released two years later, also starring Schwarzenegger. It would be the last movie where he played the role of the warrior \u2013 he was replaced by Jason Momoa of Aquaman fame in the third installment, which was released in 2012. The second film, which was shot in Mexico, was given much less space in Schwarzenegger\u2019s autobiography, a sign of his burgeoning love and interest in Spain.\nIn 2014, the Madrid City Council gave Schwarzenegger a medal as the city\u2019s first tourism ambassador. He held his sports event ACE (Arnold Classic Europe \u2013 a multi-sport and bodybuilding event) in Madrid for four years before moving it to Barcelona, and it is rumored that it could return to Madrid in 2020. \u201cI spent five months shooting [in Madrid],\u201d said Schwarzenegger when he collected his medal in the Cibeles Palace in Madrid. \u201cIt was a wonderful period of my life and the film did a lot for my career.\u201d\nSchwarzenegger also went to the southern Spanish city of Almer\u00eda in 2014, where he was awarded the Almer\u00eda Land of Cinema Award and given an honorary plaque on the Almer\u00eda Walk of Fame. He returned to the city in 2018 to shoot scenes for Terminator: Dark Fate, the sixth film in the saga which will be released in November. There are rumors now that another Conan The Barbarian film could be in the works \u2013 could this mean the former governor of California will be returning to the streets of Spain?\nEnglish version by Alicia Kember.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/10/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
