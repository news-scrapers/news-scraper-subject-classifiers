What began a century ago as a quarry from which locals would take stones to build and repair their houses has been revealed to be the remains of a fortified palatine complex from the Visigothic period \u2013 not a lone church, as was once thought.\nAfter three years of work, experts have concluded that the enclave is of \u201cenormous importance,\u201d bringing new meaning to the 7th-century town, which is surrounded by walls and turrets. The complex was located 30 kilometers from the Visigothic capital of Urbs Regia and included palaces, churches, houses, drainage systems, store houses and farming areas. The translation on one of the tombstones found in the dig has clearly indicated that it was built by a monarch whose name ended in the letters \u201cdo.\u201d\n\u201cIt was like a small R\u00e9copolis,\u201d says Jorge Mor\u00edn, director of the research, in reference to the impressive city that Visigothic King Liuvigild ordered built in Zorita de los Canes, in the eastern Spanish city of Guadalajara, in honor of his son, Recaredo.\nLos Hitos was discovered more than a century ago, and has been the subject of a wide range of interpretations. Locals had been using stones they found on the site to fix up their homes for decades, and even opened up tombs to sell their contents. This prompted the Spanish Republic\u2019s Artistic Treasures Committee, an organization set up to seize and protect Spain\u2019s cultural patrimony, to complete the first study of the site in February 1938, right in the middle of the Spanish Civil War.\nHowever, all attempts at conservation were abandoned until 2016, when the archaeological consultancy firm AUDEMA and the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, reopened the site, under the joint direction of Isabel S\u00e1nchez Ramos, and with the support of the Orgaz city council and Toledo provincial council. This is when the work took an unexpected turn.\nExcavations began again last summer in collaboration with a number of universities, including Madrid\u2019s Complutense University, C\u00f3rdoba University, San Pablo CEU University, Madrid\u2019s Polit\u00e9cnica University, Newcastle University in the UK, and Cologne University and Marburg University in Germany, as well as the Spanish Geological and Mining Institute. Three years ago, they realized that what archaeologists had supposed were the remains of a church in 1938, were in fact an aristocratic pavilion almost 11 meters tall, with a stairway leading up to a second floor.\nThe following year they found a church with a burial place in the nave in front of the choir. Later, they discovered other tombs in the south doorway, as well as an adjacent pantheon, which held the body of a man who was possibly a dux \u2013 an important member of the nobility. So far, analysis has determined he was a man of advanced age with bowed legs due to the amount of time he spent on horseback. It is thought he was probably buried with weapons and other valuables, which were plundered during the Moorish invasion. In 711, the complex was taken by the Arabs, who did not destroy it but rather changed it to suit their needs, turning the space into a kind of communications hub.\nHundreds of sculptural pieces have also been recovered from Los Hitos and are collectively considered to be the most important find from the Hispanic Gothic period. One of these pieces consists of a long inscription from a spiritual poem. It has been translated by professor Isabel Vel\u00e1zquez from Madrid\u2019s Complutense University and ends in the phrase: \u201cBuilt by \u2026do.\u201d\nThis last verse directly connects the building with a Visigothic king, which has triggered high hopes among the archaeologists. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know [if it belonged to a monarch] because we are in the first phase of the investigation, but we will find out,\u201d says Mor\u00edn.\nIn 2018, another building was located with two small doorways and a central hall, which means a new palatine construction went up toward the end of the sixth century or the start of the seventh. This building was occupied again in the 10th and 11th centuries and adapted, as was the church, which the Moors turned into a mosque. Mor\u00edn explains that it indicates that urban planning was based on Pythagoras\u2019s squares, undermining the theory that the complex was built at random and then added to.\nThis year, a wall two- to three-meters thick with rectangular turrets has been unearthed, and which the experts believe belongs to the period between Theudis (531-538) and Recaredo (586-601). Surrounding the entire town, the wall had a huge gate and adjoining warehouses and homes of around 20 square meters with a back courtyard. \u201cBesides offering protection, the wall conferred prestige indicating palatine status along with the marble that was used in its construction,\u201d says Mor\u00edn.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.", "date": "11/05/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
