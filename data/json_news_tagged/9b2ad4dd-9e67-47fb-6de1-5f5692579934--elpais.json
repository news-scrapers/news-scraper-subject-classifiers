That\u2019s according to a document to which EL PA\u00cdS has had access. This is the latest case in a deepening scandal over the projects Monasterio carried out as the head of an architect studio when she herself was not a registered architect.\nIn this case, the building certificate was for a project on a store at number 24 San Marcos street, in Madrid. By signing the document, which was published by the Spanish news site El Diario on Monday, Monasterio took responsibility for complex work that could only be authorized by an architect, including tearing down load-bearing walls, the installation of steel beams and a metal structure, and pulling down and demolishing concrete supports.\nIt was a nightmare, she destroyed our lives. This woman is a danger to the public\nClient of Roc\u00edo Monasterio\nWhat\u2019s more, Monasterio did not even have a building license to complete a project of this scale. Madrid City Hall had requested more information about the work, which was never provided. In the meantime, the project was completed in three months.\nThe property was an abandoned space in the center of Madrid that a company called Por Un D\u00eda S. L. was thinking of renting out to organize business events under its brand Versatile.\n\u201cWe spoke with three architects who told us that nothing could be done, that they would never give us a license for use, because it was in an area with a lot of noise, with residents,\u201d said Carolina D. P., the joint owner of the company. \u201cBut we spoke with Roc\u00edo Monasterio and she told us that there was no problem, that she had contacts in City Hall and would sort it out.\u201d\nThe company knew of Monasterio from her interviews in several home and decoration magazines including Elle Deco, Nuevo Estilo and Habitania. In these interviews, she presented herself as an architect, although at the time she was still not a registered professional.\n\u201cShe marketed herself very well, and she welcomed you in her studio, which was also her home \u2013 a spectacular loft that made you think that was exactly what you wanted,\u201d said Carolina.\nBut the project on San Marcos street was \u201ca complete mess,\u201d according to Carolina. \u201cThere was a spiral staircase, which were banned years ago in evacuation areas, and she put an air conditioning unit in the neighborhood terrace. It made a lot of noise and the police came by every two or three days. It was a nightmare, she destroyed our lives. This woman is a danger to the public.\u201d\nCarolina and her business partner filed a complaint against Monasterio in 2006 to seek compensation but they lost their case in 2008.\nThis is the second time that documents have been found in which Monasterio appears as the architect before she completed her end-of-year project and registered with COAM, the official architects\u2019 association of Madrid, in 2009. The first case, which was revealed by EL PA\u00cdS, took place in 2003 when she signed her name on building plans for three lofts on Villafranca street in Madrid. At a press conference on Monday, Monasterio claimed that she could not \u201crecollect when I was or wasn\u2019t an architect.\u201d A further three cases of irregularities \u2013 including the construction of her own home \u2013 have been uncovered involving Monasterio and her husband, Iv\u00e1n Espinosa de los Monteros, who is the spokesperson for Vox in Congress.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/31/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
