A statement was read out demanding a solution from the authorities, while the victim of the illegal occupation, Victoria de Castro, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been living here since 1931, please, I want to go home.\u201d\nFaced with an increasingly angry crowd, which threatened to kick down the door on several occasions, the squatters ended up calling the police to say they would leave the premises if they were guaranteed protection. The occupiers eventually walked out amid heavy security measures, and a complaint has been filed against them for usurpation of real property. Afterwards, several dozen residents headed for two other occupied homes, where the squatters also chose to leave.\n\u201cI have to thank the residents of Portugalete, because without their help this would have been impossible,\u201d said Jes\u00fas, one of De Castro\u2019s nephews. \u201cThe police were here only to defend the squatters, not us, so thank you to all the neighbors. This could happen to any resident of Portugalete.\u201d\nThe squatters have been described by some local residents as professionals with a history of taking over people\u2019s homes. \u201cWhen several of us admonished a young woman of around 20 who walked out of the house on Wednesday, she first pretended to moon us, then threatened us with an exacto knife,\u201d said one local resident.\u00a0\nUnder Spanish legislation, getting one\u2019s home back involves lengthy procedures that until recently could take up to two years. A new law introduced in 2018 seeks to reduce that to 30 days through civil, rather than criminal proceedings. But the long time frames and complicated paperwork pushes many homeowners to simply pay the squatters to leave.\nIn Victoria de Castro\u2019s case, popular pressure has managed to push out the squatters after five days. By contrast, the court hearing to deal with her complaint had been scheduled for November 20.\nThere are around 87,000 homes in Spain being illegally occupied, according to the Cerd\u00e0 Institute, a consulting foundation. But those are just the ones whose owners have filed police complaints, and the real number could be closer to 100,000. The type of squatter has changed, too.\n\u201cWe are finding problems every day in luxury residential areas. The squatters are no longer simply families without financial resources. The problem is the proliferation of mafias,\u201d says \u00d3scar Arag\u00f3n, director general of VPS, a company that fits homes with anti-squatter systems.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/18/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
