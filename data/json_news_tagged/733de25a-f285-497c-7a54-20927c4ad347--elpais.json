It also repairs and builds ships while its own ships take passengers up the Danube. Until 2016, the family of Francisco Franco Mart\u00ednez Bordi\u00fa \u2013 the oldest grandson of the late Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, and better known as Francis \u2013 controlled this firm via Tabacmesa SA, one of the family\u2019s seven companies. In 2016, Tabacmesa SA sold its share for \u20ac7.5 million, according to company records.\nFranco himself was earning a mere \u20ac300 per year as head of state in 1940 so where did all the money come from?\nThe shipping business is just the tip of the iceberg of the vast business conglomerate controlled by the seven children born to Carmen Franco, the dictator\u2019s only child, who died in 2017 at the age of 91. The dictator\u2019s grandchildren oversee a complex web of 21 companies with a collective net worth of \u20ac102.5 million, and their assets include 404 properties, according to an investigation by EL PA\u00cdS. The property portfolio alone consists of a palace, 89 homes, 266 garage spaces, 29 country estates, five commercial premises and three rural plots.\nAlthough mainly linked to real estate, the dictator\u2019s descendants have their fingers in a number of pies, such as public relations (Ocnarf S. L.), daycare centers (Servicios Infantiles Dulcinea S. L.) and hotels (CM 16 S. L.).\nThe family also has a 17% share in Dulcinea Nutrition S. L., which has a catering contract with La Moncloa, the seat of the Spanish government. Despite earning \u20ac3 million from public agencies between 2016 and 2019, the company staff has not been paid regularly, resulting in strikes. The Defense Staff, the Higher Council for Scientific Research (CSIC), the Labor Ministry and the city of M\u00e1laga have all contracted the services of this company, which is based in Puertollano (Ciudad Real).\nThe fact that Francisco Franco himself was earning a mere 50,000 pesetas (\u20ac300) per year as head of state in 1940 begs the question: where did all this money come from?\nTo understand the miracle, you have to go to the heart of Madrid, or to be more precise, to number 8, Hermanos B\u00e9cquer street in the upscale Salamanca district. This palatial building is the Franco clan\u2019s jewel in the crown; it has seven floors, 4,800 square meters and is worth \u20ac50 million.\nThe property was part of Carmen Franco\u2019s estate and now acts as the headquarters for her children\u2019s property companies Fiolasa SLU and Sargo Consulting S. L. These were run by Carmen Polo during her lifetime; she was addressed as Your Excellency and, in 2009, was earning \u20ac17,000 a month from her various business interests.\nFour of the seven companies belonging to Francis, the most powerful of Franco\u2019s grandchildren, are based in Hermanos B\u00e9cquer street. His net assets are worth \u20ac44.7 million and he controls 367 properties: 85 homes, one of which is a 349 square-meter house in the middle of Serrano Street, a 1,175-square-meter warehouse in Madrid and five commercial premises, including 259 square meters of office space on Ayala street in the Salamanca district, where a square meter is worth between \u20ac8,000 and \u20ac10,000. There are also two duplexes in Talavera de la Reina (Toledo) measuring 80 square meters and 109 square meters, respectively.\nMost of the money, however, is in parking lots. Francis has 264 parking spaces in the center of Madrid owned by three different companies. One of these, Tabacmesa SA, owns the parking lot at number 15, General Pardi\u00f1as street. With a surface area of 3,992 square meters, it has 170 spaces that are rented out for \u20ac181.50 a month. Another company, Pristina S. L., has 22 parking spaces on Pr\u00edncipe de Vergara street. And since 2015 it has been renting out the ground floor of number 203, Alcal\u00e1 street to the bank BBVA, an area measuring 1,079 square meters.\nThe family has a 17% share in the company that runs the cafeteria at La Moncloa Palace\nFrancis refused to divulge details about his businesses, but confirmed the information uncovered by EL PA\u00cdS. In three conversations with this newspaper, he dodged questions about his interests abroad \u2013 besides his share in the Slovakian shipping line, which earned him \u20ac449,870 in dividends in 2014, he also owned shares in tobacco companies \u2013 Frontera Spol and Koslava Spol in the Czech Republic, Andradi Com in Romania and Helitrade Spol in Slovakia, according to Tabacmesa corporate records. In December 2016 he sold this international conglomerate that focused on duty free cigarette sales.\nBut these weren\u2019t Francis\u2019 only foreign ventures. His company Montecopel SA, with net assets of\u00a0 \u20ac12.4 million, filed for the tax amnesty offered by Mariano Rajoy\u2019s government in 2012. This move shed light on \u20ac7.6 million of previously undeclared foreign income, company records show.\u00a0 The tax amnesty allowed individuals and companies to pay 10% on their undeclared money, which was significantly less than the amount of tax that was originally dodged.\nAccording to Francis, his business career took off in South America. \u201cIn 1980 I moved to Chile where I lived for six years, then [I spent] 10 more in Argentina,\u201d he explains. \u201cThat was where I cemented my career as a businessman; the same as my son Francisco, who has lived in Switzerland and the United States for half his life.\u201d\nMar\u00eda de la O Mart\u00ednez Bordi\u00fa, otherwise known as Mariola, has enjoyed a similar degree of success in her business dealings. Her company Domarma 3 S. L., manages assets worth a net \u20ac5 million. She also has a 20% share in the chain of daycare centers Servicios Infantiles Dulcinea S. L., a company that employs 84 workers in Guadalajara, Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n (Madrid) and Puertollano (Ciudad Real). Mariola also has a 17% share in Dulcinea Nutrici\u00f3n S. L., which has a staff of 230 and sales worth \u20ac7.4 million, according to recent records.\nMariola also has a line of business in public government contracts. Together with the \u20ac1.9 million, four-year cafeteria concession at\u00a0 La Moncloa Palace, Dulcinea Nutrici\u00f3n S. L. has a catering contract with the Migrant Temporary Stay Center (CETI) in Ceuta; its late payments to staff has earned it headlines in the Spanish exclave city. EL PA\u00cdS has tried unsuccessfully to reach Servicios Infantiles Dulcinea S. L. and Dulcinea Nutrici\u00f3n S. L. for comment.\nBut Mariola\u2019s main business interest lies in a company called CM 16 S. L., where she and her children are listed as board members. With assets worth \u20ac10 million, it spent \u20ac2.5 million in 2010 on turning a palace in the center of Seville into a five-star hotel with 50 rooms. Two years earlier, the company built a block of seven properties in Plaza de Delicias in Madrid. In 2010, it also invested \u20ac1.5 million on acquiring 5% of a building in the district of Salamanca. In 2012, it bought another property in the capital for \u20ac1.6 million.\nMariola\u2019s family business also has a 20% share in Breda Capital, which runs a five-star hotel promising \u201chedonistic levels of luxury\u201d in Velazquez street in the Salamanca district. EL PA\u00cdS tried unsuccessfully to talk to Breda Capital and Mar\u00eda de la O Mart\u00ednez Bordi\u00fa.\nThe Franco empire has ventured into construction, public relations, daycare centers and hotels\nAcross the pond, CM 16 S. L. has a 9.5% share in a property in Savannah, Georgia, and cashes dividends from Komar Investment, according to this company\u2019s records.\nBesides Mar\u00eda del Carmen Mart\u00ednez Bordi\u00fa, who owns almost 10,000 square meters of land spread over three rural plots in the northern region of Cantabria, the rest of the dictator\u2019s grandchildren are in one way or another linked to the family web of companies \u2013 Mar\u00eda del Mar with assets worth \u20ac4.1 million, Mar\u00eda Aranzazu (\u20ac3.6 million), Jos\u00e9 Crist\u00f3bal (\u20ac2.9 million) and Jaime Felipe Mart\u00ednez Bordi\u00fa (\u20ac900,000).\nIt is a fortune that, according to sources close to the family, can be traced back to a speculative property deal regarding the sale of an estate in Arroyomolinos in Madrid. In the 1940s, when the dictator struck the deal, the land was classified as rural and could not be built on, but in 2003 it was rezoned, prompting its value to soar.\nBut according to the Franco clan\u2019s estate administrator, Luis Felipe Utrera-Molina, the vast inheritance had more to do with the dictator\u2019s wife, Carmen Polo. \u201cThe Polo family was very rich,\u201d says this lawyer who describes Francisco Franco as a moral man who could not be accused of greed.\nThis article was updated on November 19, 2019 with new data collected by EL PA\u00cdS from the Spanish property registry.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/07/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
