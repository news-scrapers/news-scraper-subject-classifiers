It will be a progressive government whatever the case. A progressive government made up of progressive forces that are going to work for progress. There is no room for hatred between Spaniards,\u201d he said, in a thinly veiled reference to far-right group Vox. The caretaker prime minister went on to say that the government would last \u201cfor four years, the entire term.\u201d\nThe two leaders shook hands and hugged each other as the press conference came to an end, with wide smiles after the assembled staff and journalists in the room let out a collective \u201cAhhhhhh!\u201d on seeing the pair embrace.\nDIRECTO https://t.co/Zyd50iAzue S\u00e1nchez da un abrazo a Pablo Iglesias: \"Gracias por la generosidad\" pic.twitter.com/pLdBDKpohT\n S\u00e1nchez and Iglesias hug after their joint press conference on Tuesday. \u201cThank you for the generosity,\u201d the PSOE leader tells Iglesias.\nSunday\u2019s election was called by S\u00e1nchez after negotiations between the PSOE and Unidas Podemos broke down in the wake of the April 28 general election, which returned a similar inconclusive result to this weekend\u2019s poll. During those talks the PSOE had offered Unidas Podemos a role as deputy prime minister as well as the control of three ministries, but Iglesias turned them down.\nThe general election on Sunday saw S\u00e1nchez lose three seats in Congress, falling from 123 to 120 in a 350-seat parliament where 176 votes are needed for a majority. Podemos took 35 seats, falling from the 42 it won in April. The big winner on Sunday night was Vox, which went from 24 seats to 52, becoming the third-biggest political force in Congress after the PSOE and conservative Popular Party (PP).\nTalks between the leaders of the PSOE and Unidas Podemos began on Monday night in complete secrecy. It was only this morning, when the preliminary agreement was already on its way, that Socialist sources went public.\nThe same sources explained that now that the deal is done, there will be talks with other political groups who supported S\u00e1nchez\u2019s successful motion of no-confidence against former PP Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy last summer, a move that saw the Socialist politician take power.\nJust this morning, the president of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), Andoni Ortuzar, said that he was willing to recover the block of allies that came together to oust Rajoy and get S\u00e1nchez into power. This block includes parties that support Catalan independence.\nThe leader of the main opposition Popular Party, Pablo Casado, today informed party chiefs of the pre-agreement during a meeting of the group\u2019s national executive committee. PP sources said that the deal between S\u00e1nchez and Iglesias frees the party of the pressure to support the PSOE in the formation of a government, and clears the way for them to exercise responsible opposition. The PP, the same sources said, is the \u201conly alternative\u201d to S\u00e1nchez.\nSpeaking shortly after 3pm, Casado held a press conference at PP headquarters. \u201cWe have heard the news that many Spaniards feared,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cPedro S\u00e1nchez has announced a deal and has offered the role of deputy prime minister to Iglesias to form a radical government, which is the opposite of what Spain needs. For this journey [...] there was no need to be subjected to surrealistic negotiations for six months, with territorial tensions and employment problems.\u201d\nCasado went on to call for S\u00e1nchez to step down. \u201cThe historical PSOE must return,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for S\u00e1nchez to go because he is the blockage, but it\u2019s also important for the sensible PSOE to return. The public should be calling on him to emerge from the labyrinth in which he entered.\u201d\nWe are not going to be part of a government that he calls progressive, but which is on the radical left\nPP leader Pablo Casado\nThe PP leader also ruled out any kind of deal or support for the PSOE. \u201cWe are not going to be part of a government that he calls progressive, but which is on the radical left, and in cahoots with the Catalan regional government, which is breaking the law. We will be up to the circumstances.\u201d\nMeanwhile, center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) stated that it would not support S\u00e1nchez\u2019s deal with Podemos. \u201cWe call on the responsibility of the PSOE and PP to reach a moderate deal with Ciudadanos that respects the Constitution, based on good state deals for our country,\u201d the party said. \u201cCiudadanos cannot back S\u00e1nchez and Podemos taking the reins of the Spanish government. It is disastrous and runs counter to the interests of the majority of Spaniards.\u201d\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n, the leader of new party M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds, applauded today\u2019s preliminary agreement, saying that his group \u2013 which took three seats at Sunday\u2019s polls \u2013 would vote in favor of Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s investiture in Congress. Errej\u00f3n, a co-founder of Podemos who left the party after falling out with Pablo Iglesias, said via Twitter that \u201cSpaniards have given a second chance to a progressive government to create a fairer country. And we must comply with that mandate. We salute the pre-agreement and we will work to see it backed by a majority.\u201d\nWith reporting from Carlos E.
