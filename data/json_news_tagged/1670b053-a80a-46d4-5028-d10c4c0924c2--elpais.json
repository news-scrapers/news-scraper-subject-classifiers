Yet these small creatures are, in fact, fearful and harmless.\nThe young of the blue shark (Prionace glauca) are an increasingly common sight off the coast of Galicia, in northwestern Spain. It is a trend that has bewildered marine specialists since 2012. Just days ago, 16 pups turned up at Valdovi\u00f1o beach, prompting the lifeguards to clear the sea of bathers.\nThey eat small fish and cephalopods and they are fearful and quick to take flight\nGonzalo Mucientes, Blue Ecology\nEvery summer for the past seven years, these sharks have made an appearance along this coast. Initially, workers at the Coordination Center for the Study of Marine Mammals (Cemma) believed that they had been caught accidentally by fishermen and returned to the sea with injuries, causing them to be dragged by currents to the shore. \u201cOver the past three or four years, we have realized that this is not the case \u2013 that it is an ongoing phenomenon,\u201d says Alfredo L\u00f3pez, a biologist with Cemma, which was founded in Galicia almost 30 years ago.\nThese peculiar visitors are just weeks or months old, and are coming into Galicia\u2019s estuaries and even ports for food, at times in large groups, according to Gonzalo Mucientes, from the Blue Ecology association. A marine biologist specializing in the species, he has drawn up a register of summer shark sightings in conjunction with Cemma and the \u201cSharks in Galicia\u201d blogger To\u00f1o Ma\u00f1o in a bid to figure out what is going on, though the investigation has not yet yielded any solid conclusions.\nLast year saw the largest number of sightings \u2013 123 registered \u2013 with more than 200 blue sharks seen along the coast of Galicia, from the R\u00edas Baixas to Ferrol. By comparison, in 2016 and 2017 combined there were 65 sightings comprising 106 sharks, according to data presented by the researchers at the 7th Iberian Ichthyology Congress in Portugal. The specialists pointed out that the increase does not necessarily mean more blue sharks, but rather a more efficient surveillance network.\nMucientes has two theories to explain the blue sharks\u2019 presence. \u201cOn one hand, they might be pushing their nursery zone closer the coast due to a change in water temperature,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the other, there may be an increase in the number of young, leading them to come close [to land] as they compete for food.\u201d\nBlue sharks have between 30 and 40 pups per litter, after a gestation period of between nine and 12 months during which time food is passed from mother to babies through a tube not unlike the umbilical cord. This takes place out at sea, beyond the Galicia sea bank, located 200 miles offshore. The anomaly is that these pups are traveling that enormous distance to the coast.\nBut according to Mucientes, the threat they pose is negligible. \u201cThey eat small fish and cephalopods and they are fearful and quick to take flight,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cThey could be harmful without wanting to be if someone caught them, as they have teeth.\u201d\nThe increase does not necessarily mean more blue sharks, but rather a more efficient surveillance network\nCemma researchers also insist these sharks are harmless, though they approve of the lifeguards\u2019 response in Valdovi\u00f1o as, due to their numbers, there was a fair chance of touching one accidentally, which could lead to an involuntary bite. At Valdovi\u00f1o, the blue sharks were mistaken for short-fin mako sharks, which are also inoffensive but cause more panic due to their large teeth and speed \u2013 they are the world\u2019s fastest shark.\nThe baby blues such as those in Valdovi\u00f1o will not approach anything bigger than themselves, although Cemma\u2019s advice includes leaving them alone. The organization also suggests returning stranded blue sharks to the sea using a towel and avoiding the dorsal fin. Beachgoers should call 112 or inform lifeguards if they come across one on the sand.\nThe visiting blue shark phenomenon is mainly confined to Galicia, though there have been sightings off the coast of Asturias and Portugal as well. Mucientes believes that it is due to certain features specific to the Galician coast, such as the estuaries, which form small pools of calm water.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/05/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
