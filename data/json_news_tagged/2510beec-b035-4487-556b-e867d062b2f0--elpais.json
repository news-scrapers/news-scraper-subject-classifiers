Her defense is pleading reckless homicide, claiming that the child attacked Quezada with a hatchet and that she acted in self-defense.\nOn Thursday, the jury appeared to show keen interest as they watched a video of a handcuffed Quezada, dressed in a red hooded jumper, crying as she explained how she murdered the eight-year-old boy \u2013 a very different image to the crestfallen and distant woman seen in court.\nShe began to blame third parties and even spoke badly of the boy\nCivil Guard Captain Hidalgo\nAll eyes except hers were fixed to the screen as it played the 27-minute video, which included footage of the rural property in Rodalquilar where the child\u2019s life was ended on February 27, 2018.\nIn the video, Judge Rafael Serrano accompanies Quezada as she reenacts her movements from that day. He walks with her into the small room on the property where Quezada says Gabriel entered with a hatchet. \u201cI tried to get it off him. He called me black. He began to scream and scream!\u201d When the judge asks what she was thinking after the murder, Quezada begins to sob: \u201cI was thinking about his father, how I am going to tell his father?\u201d\nQuezada and the judge then leave the room and go to the spot where she buried the boy. She describes how she dug the grave, took off Gabriel\u2019s clothes and dragged him into the hole. Quezada says she tried to cut off the boy\u2019s hand and then buried him. The judge asks if she hit the boy with the hatchet or if she beat him. Quezada replies no.\nOn the day of the reconstruction, Civil Guard officers brought a dog to the rural property to track Gabriel\u2019s scent. The animal stopped at four spots: a mop, the mop bucket, the place in the room where he was murdered, and the site where he was buried.\nThe jury was also shown photos of Gabriel\u2019s clothes (shoes, sweatpants, shirt and jacket) shoved in a glass container, and another shirt covered in mud that Quezada planted in a cane field.\nA Civil Guard officer said Quezada wanted to keep the money Gabriel\u2019s family offered as a reward\nFourteen Civil Guard officers who took part in the investigation also testified on Thursday at the trial that began Monday in Almer\u00eda. One officer told the jury that Gabriel was walking to his cousins\u2019 house in Las Hortichuelas, located 117 meters away in a straight line, when he was intercepted by Quezada.\nThe jury watched footage of Quezada opening the trunk of her car and placing Gabriel\u2019s body inside. They also listened to an audio of her saying to herself \u201cNow let\u2019s take you away from here,\u201d and \u201cAna, you are not going to go to jail,\u201d which was recorded by a microphone the police had planted in her car.\nThe trial also heard from Captain Hidalgo from the Civil Guard, who said that from the beginning of the investigation Quezada\u2019s behavior was \u201cnot cooperative.\u201d \u201cShe began to blame third parties and even spoke badly of the boy.\u201d According to Hidalgo, Quezada said Gabriel had insulted her and underestimated her strength when she tried to defend herself from the boy: \u201cShe did not make a lot of sense.\u201d\nThe captain said Quezada lied about things that had no relevance to the case, which aroused investigators\u2019 suspicions. Civil Guard officer Commander Montero also told the jury that the self-confessed killer appeared to want to keep the money Gabriel\u2019s family had offered as a reward during the 11-day search for the child. \u201cShe seemed macabre. She wanted money,\u201d he said.\nThe Civil Guard officers also said that after her arrest on March 11, 2018, Quezada\u2019s first words were \u201c\u00c1ngel, I love you a lot, I love Gabriel, my dog is inside [the car].\u201d\nQuezada\u2019s defense lawyer, Esteban Hern\u00e1ndez, objected on several occasions that he was not able to question the investigators, arguing the right to defense was being \u201cviolated.\u201d\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/13/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
