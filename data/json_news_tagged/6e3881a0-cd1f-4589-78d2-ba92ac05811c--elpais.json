Starting that year, when the independence movement gained significant momentum, attendance figures hovered around the one million mark, according to the Barcelona police. This year, the figure was closer to 600,000.\nWhile the Catalan premier at the time, Carles Puigdemont, fled Spain with a few aides and settled down in Belgium, other members of his government were arrested and have been held in preventive prison since then. The Supreme Court, which tried 12 leaders of the illegal breakaway attempt in February, is expected to hand down a ruling on the case in the first half of October.\nLeading members of the march made public statements promising to keep working toward independence, despite the fact that the separatist movement is now politically divided compared with 2017, the year of the unauthorized referendum and unilateral independence declaration.\n\u201cToday, there are thousands of us marching under a very simple slogan: \u2018Objective: independence\u2019 and that is our challenge,\u201d said Quim Torra, the Catalan premier, at the end of the march. \u201cToday, a period ends and the response to the ruling begins. We will put the goal of independence at the center of political action.\u201d\n\u201cWhen injustice is the law, civil disobedience is a right, and we will not give up on defending our rights through non-violent struggle in order to change reality and unfair laws,\u201d said Marcel Mauri, vice-president of the pro-independence association Omnium.\nEarlier in the day, the rain did not prevent the traditional offering of flowers at the foot of the statue of Rafael Casanova, a hero of the 1714 Siege of Barcelona.\nThe speaker of the Catalan parliament, Roger Torrent, underscored that his predecessor Carme Forcadell remains in preventive custody while awaiting the Supreme Court decision. \u201cWe are part of another exceptional Diada due to the existence of political prisoners,\u201d he said.\nTorrent, of the Catalan Republican Party (ERC), thinks that the upcoming court ruling will open up a new political cycle in which it will be necessary to \u201cbuild broad majorities, which exist in this country, who say they don\u2019t want repression, that they want a democratic society and who share a republican agenda.\u201d\nThe Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and Units per Avan\u00e7ar (United to Move Forward) were the only non-separatist parties to take part in the flower ceremony, where they asked for a \u201cnew consensus\u201d to bridge the divide between Catalans who are for and against independence.\nOther non-nationalist parties made statements along those lines.\nHartos de que el separatismo nos excluya de una fiesta que deber\u00eda ser de todos. Cansados de que Torra y su gobierno hable en nombre de todos los catalanes. Ni la #Diada ni Catalu\u00f1a es solo de aquellos que quieren separarnos del resto de Espa\u00f1a. Avui i sempre #Catalu\u00f1aSomosTodos pic.twitter.com/LHcAoxnlsT\n\u201cTired of being excluded by separatists from a celebration that should belong to everyone. Tired of hearing [Catalonia\u2019s separatist premier] Torra and his government speaking in the name of all Catalans. Neither the Diada nor Catalonia belong just to those who want to separate us from the rest of Spain,\u201d tweeted Laura V\u00edlchez of Ciudadanos.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/11/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
