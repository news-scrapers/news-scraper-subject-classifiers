First- and second-quarter growth were both around 0.5%, making it difficult for the economy to expand at a rate of 2.2% in 2019, as the Spanish government had forecast.\nThe numbers also show that the Spanish economy grew 2.4% in 2018, rather than the expected 2.6%. The revised figures are part of periodic statistical reviews of the annual national accounts carried out by the INE.\nThis means that 2019 growth will be below the analysts\u2019 forecasts. First-quarter growth was 0.5%, two-tenths of a point below the earlier estimate, and 0.48% in the second quarter.\n\u201cWith these new figures, the 2.2% growth forecast made earlier by [think tank] Funcas is now outdated. The real number will most likely be somewhere between 2% and 2.1%,\u201d said Funcas analyst Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez. \u201cThe review of the 2019 first-quarter figures will be confirmed by the INE on September 30.\u201d\nSummer figures showed a slump in employment, with industry and exports affected by global uncertainty despite steady consumption levels. The latest INE data also shows that household spending is slowing down. Between April and June, quarterly consumption remained stuck at 0.02%, while investment retreated 0.15%.\nSpain\u2019s GDP is \u20ac6 billion lower than the previous calculation\nAs for 2018, the revised figures show that household consumption grew 1.8%, while business investment expanded 6.1% and government spending was up 2.1%.\nThe statistics bureau has revised figures for Spain\u2019s main economic aggregates going back to 1995, and until 2002 the new numbers are mostly higher than originally calculated. After that, the reviewed numbers have been mostly corrected downward. The average impact on the accounts was -0.4% for the 24 years under review, said the INE.\nThe message is that Spaniards are producing and earning slightly less than previously reported. Right now, GDP is \u20ac6 billion lower than the previous calculation, and now stands at \u20ac1.202 trillion at the close of 2018 compared with \u20ac1.208 trillion.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/17/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
