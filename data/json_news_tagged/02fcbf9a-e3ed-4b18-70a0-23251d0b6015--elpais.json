He first tried to jump over the fence separating Moroccan territory from the Spanish exclave city of Melilla in January, but failed. He made four unsuccessful attempts before clearing the fence on his fifth try, in April.\nParis views the southern European border as a gateway into France for irregular migrants\n\u201cEverything bad that happens in Morocco does not happen here: here I have a place to sleep, I am studying, and I am waiting for all of my siblings, who are in Nador and going through a hard time to make it [into Spain],\u201d he says.\nHis is not an isolated experience: reaching Spain from Morocco has become harder, riskier and more expensive. The latest data on irregular migrant arrivals through this route, covering the present year to Tuesday of this week, shows a 39% drop compared with the same period in 2018, for a total of 18,018 people.\nWith financial and logistical backing from the EU and Spain, Morocco has deployed its security forces to contain the migratory pressure on Europe. The Spanish government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez has presented Morocco as a strategic partner in the fight against unauthorized immigration, and got Brussels to extend a \u20ac140 million check to that country in exchange for its assistance. Spain will add \u20ac30 million in support.\nThe 39% drop means that the Spanish government is coming closer to its goal of reducing irregular immigration by half in 2019. Last year, by comparison, the western Mediterranean route became the main gateway into Europe after Italy closed off access to its ports. As a result, there were 65,000 arrivals in Spain. These days, it is Greece that is seeing the highest arrival figures in the Mediterranean: 28,200 so far this year.\nMorocco\u2019s assistance has been essential to Spain\u2019s ability to present itself to Brussels as the EU member who is doing the best job at controlling Europe\u2019s southern border. Pressure from the EU has been increasing, and not everyone approved of Spain\u2019s unilateral decision last year to take in the Aquarius, a migrant ship that had been refused entry by Malta and Italy. Paris, for instance, views the southern European border as a gateway into France. A recent study by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) showed that a little over half of the people arriving in Spain stay there; France is the second country of preference.\nRabat and Madrid have reactivated bilateral agreements that had been dropped, such as the one allowing for the quick return of migrants to Moroccan territory right after they jump the fences at Ceuta and Melilla. Moroccan security forces have also intensified the number of raids, forced transfers and deportations. Moroccan statistics, which the EU considers unreliable, show that Rabat has stopped 42,000 crossing attempts. The vast majority of would-be border crossers, 80%, hail from sub-Saharan Africa.\nEverything bad that happens in Morocco does not happen here: here I have a place to sleep, I am studying, and I am waiting for all of my siblings\nBara Nourdin, migrant\nFor the first time, Morocco has also become involved in maritime activities. All the operations that had been carried out by Spanish teams in Morocco\u2019s search-and-rescue zone are now being handled by the Moroccan Royal Navy, which takes the rescued migrants back to their departure point. Official Moroccan government sources told EL PA\u00cdS that 8,000 people have been rescued at sea.\nThe new dynamics have opened up new routes that are longer and more dangerous. \u201cMigrants are increasingly departing from the western coast of Morocco, near the cities of Kenitra, Rabat, Skhirat and Casablanca. This leads to more accidents and more scams by the clandestine smuggling networks,\u201d warns an internal report from Brussels that this newspaper has seen. To mid-August, 208 people have died or disappeared during the crossing to Spain, representing one out of every 100 people who attempt the journey, according to the IOM.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/16/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
