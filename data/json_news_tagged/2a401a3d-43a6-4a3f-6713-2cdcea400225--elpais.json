It will be Spain\u2019s fourth national election in under four years.\nThat kind of rhetoric mobilizes the left. Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t spread\nAnonymous PP congressman\nD\u00edaz Ayuso argued that S\u00e1nchez\u2019s plans to exhume Franco\u2019s remains from the Valley of the Fallen monument \u2013 a signature project of the PSOE\u2019s that has been delayed for years due to legal hurdles \u2013 is an attempt at attracting leftist voters. She also called it highly divisive, and resorted to Civil War imagery to suggest what could come next.\n\u201cWhat will it be next? [Taking down] the cross from the valley? The entire valley? The neighborhood churches? Will they burn like they did in 1936?\u201d said D\u00edaz Ayuso, a former journalist who took office in August on a message of \u201cconsensus and dialogue above permanent tension and conflict.\u201d\nHer words did not sit well with PP leaders, who have adopted a milder tone ahead of the November polls compared to their campaigning in April of this year. On Thursday, party chief Pablo Casado was in Melilla, a Spanish exclave city in North Africa, where he spoke about \u201crespecting everyone\u2019s religious freedom on the strength of the principles that unite us.\u201d He also said it was better not to engage \u201cin debates that are of no interest to anyone.\u201d\nBut Casado\u2019s attempt at sending out the message that only the PP can avoid a new economic crisis in Spain was eclipsed by D\u00edaz Ayuso\u2019s headline-grabbing statements. \u201cThat kind of rhetoric mobilizes the left. Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t spread,\u201d said one PP congressman.\n\u201cThey go crazy over Franco. It\u2019s the party people who share that kind of opinion who see you end up with fewer than 66 seats [in Congress]. Most of our potential voters are not into that kind of narrative, let alone younger people,\u201d said another PP leader.\nPP president Casado has adopted a discreet position with regard to Franco\u2019s exhumation. When the project was put to a vote in Congress, the PP did not vote against but rather abstained, arguing that they do not see it as a priority and that money should not be spent on it. Casado has said in the past that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t spend a euro on digging up Franco.\u201d\nCasado personally selected D\u00edaz Ayuso as the PP candidate ahead of the regional elections of May and entrusted her with a mission: to stem the loss of voters who were switching to the far-right party Vox. The choice raised some eyebrows among senior party members due to her lack of political experience, but D\u00edaz Ayuso ultimately managed to keep the PP in control of a regional government that handles an annual budget of over \u20ac20 billion.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/04/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
