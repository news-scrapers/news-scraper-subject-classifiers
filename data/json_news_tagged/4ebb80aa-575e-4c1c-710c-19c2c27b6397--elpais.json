But even if he was not the winner among the five prime ministerial candidates who took part in the event, as other surveys found, he did gain the most from participating.\nAbascal\u2019s tax cuts will benefit the highest earners more than anyone else\nMonday was the first time that the Vox leader had had the chance to address such a large audience \u2013 a total of 8.2 million people tuned in to watch the debate on state broadcaster TVE on Monday night. His competitors \u2013 caretaker Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez of the Socialist Party (PSOE), Pablo Casado of the Popular Party (PP), Pablo Iglesis of Unidas Podemos and Albert Rivera of Ciudadanos (Citizens) \u2013 are more accustomed to such exposure. And those who believe that he won the debate account for a higher percentage of votes than those the party actually secured at the last, inconclusive, general election, which was held on April 28. At that poll, Vox took 24 seats in the Congress of Deputies, debuting in Spain\u2019s lower house of parliament as the fifth-most voted party.\nExperts agree that the Vox leader gained confidence as the debate went on. He visibly relaxed as the minutes passed, and he looked his opponents directly in the eye when he spoke \u2013 something that not all of the participants did. His messages were simple and direct, easily understood and none of the other candidates sought to deconstruct them.\nThe PP has already secured the support of Vox in a number of regions and municipalities in order to form coalition governments with Ciudadanos (in the Madrid, Andalusia and Murcia regions, as well as the Spanish capital\u2019s City Hall), and as such Pablo Casado avoided any friction with Abascal on Monday night, given the possibility of a similar deal being necessary after Sunday\u2019s vote.\nFor the most humble Spaniards, Spain is their only asset\nVox leader Santiago Abascal\nPedro S\u00e1nchez, meanwhile, sought to ignore Abascal entirely, using Vox\u2019s policies \u2013 which include the outlawing of pro-Catalan independence parties, and the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) \u2013 to attack the leaders of the PP and Ciudadanos for getting into bed with Vox.\nAlbert Rivera, meanwhile, was more aggressive with all of the participants during Monday\u2019s debate, and drew attention to the fact that Abascal \u2013 a career public servant \u2013 had earned a salary in excess of \u20ac80,000 a year in a publicly funded foundation belonging to the Madrid regional government, to which he had been personally appointed by then-premier Esperanza Aguirre.\nThe \u201cwasteful spending\u201d by Spain\u2019s system of autonomous regional governments, and the issue of irregular immigration, were the two main thrusts of Abascal\u2019s arguments. He cited questionable figures such as the yearly cost to the state of the regions being as high as \u20ac90 billion, and the duplication of functions across the entire public administrations as costing \u20ac24 billion. His opponents said nothing in response to these claims. Abascal went on to contrast this enormous cost with social spending. In the end, he argued, there will have to be a choice: \u201cEither the regions, or pensions.\u201d He did, however, defend the provincial branch of Spain\u2019s public administrations, something that Ciudadanos wants to abolish.\nVox has not altered its policies, but it has amended its rhetoric. Rivera denounced the far-right party\u2019s approach as being protectionist, and Abascal did not deny this \u2013 although the reality is that its economic manifesto is ultra-liberal. This is evident from the measures that the party leader cursorily mentioned on Monday: a reduction of the highest income tax rate of 30% to 15%, a three-point cut in company tax, and the abolition of wealth and inheritance taxes, to do away with what he called the \u201cfiscal plundering of the middle and working classes.\u201d What\u2019s more, he touted a \u201cstructural reform of the pension system,\u201d which consists of dismantling and partially privatizing the current system.\nAbascal promised to \u201creform the pension system\u201d by dismantling and partially privatizing the current system\nWhile these measures will benefit the highest earners more than anyone else, Abascal was making use of populist language. \u201cFor the most humble Spaniards, Spain is their only asset; only the rich can allow themselves the luxury of not having a homeland,\u201d he said, paraphrasing Ramiro Ledesma Ramos, one of the pioneers in the introduction of fascism in Spain.\nAbascal sought to gain the support of the more modest sectors of society by citing the issue of citizen safety, something he directly linked to irregular immigration, and to the battle between Spaniards and foreigners for scant social resources. \u201cHow is the state going to deal with Spaniards who are in need if it attends to those from outside first?\u201d he asked.\nHe made his remedy for the situation clear: cut off all healthcare for irregular immigrants and discriminate against foreigners when it comes to accessing housing and social benefits. Gender violence does not exist for Vox, and according to the party, what women want is \u201cfor us to give them security\u201d from rapists, something he also linked to immigrants. He also proposed that convicted sexual predators be given life sentences, something that is currently prohibited under the Spanish Constitution.\nAccording to all of the available polls \u2013 apart from that of the CIS public research institute, which Abascal disregards \u2013 the debate has given Vox a new boost ahead of Sunday\u2019s vote. The party has been focusing its campaigning in Andalusia, where it has held 15 official rallies or events since October; Castilla-La Mancha (10); and the Valencia region (6). It is thanks to support in these regions that Vox is hoping to become the third-biggest force in Congress.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/06/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
