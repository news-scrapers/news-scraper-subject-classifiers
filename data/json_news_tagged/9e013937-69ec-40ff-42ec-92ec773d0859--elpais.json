But in Spain the figure is even higher. According to public documents from the Spanish government, trash from building and demolition work accounts for 40% of all waste, which is between 10 and 15 percentage points above the EU average.\nBut while Spaniards are slowly assuming the responsibility of reducing waste and recycling household garbage, the giant construction sector has made no effort to join the circular economy. Rubble, bricks, door frames, pipes, beams and cables continue to end up in dumps across the country \u2013 many of them illegal.\nTrash from construction and demolition work accounts for 40% of all waste\nFrance, which recently laid out an ambitious circular economy plan, is also worried about construction and demolition waste. According to the French minister for ecological transition, Brune Poirson, \u201cin terms of unused carpet alone, a roll that could cover the [thousand-kilometer] route from Lille to Marsella is thrown out every year.\u201d\nThis economic and environmental problem is avoidable, given that the main waste products from the sector \u2013 concrete, ceramic material and asphalt aggregate \u2013 \u201ccan be recycled infinitely,\u201d according to Pablo P\u00e9rez, the technical director of the Demolition and Construction Waste Recycling Interest Group, which represents recycling companies in the Spanish regions of Andalusia, Galicia and Madrid. P\u00e9rez says that part of the problem is that \u201cthere is no culture\u201d of separating waste from construction work and demolitions in Spain. The alternative \u2013 dumping mixed waste \u2013\u00a0is cheaper and easier, and while it is illegal it often goes unpunished.\nA 2008 royal decree states that all waste from building work must be treated by an authorized waste-management company, which must prioritize recycling and only use landfill as a last resort. \u201cAll types of waste comply with this [decree], except construction waste,\u201d says Benito Garc\u00eda, the spokesperson for the Demolition and Construction Waste Recycling Interest Group.\nA 2008 royal decree states that all waste from building work must be treated by an authorized waste-management company\nIn order to comply with waste regulations, each city council must collect a waste-management fee from the companies and individuals who request a building license. But the interest group says that only 8% of councils do this, and according to the Demolition and Construction Waste Recycling Interest Group, which represents waste-management companies in Castille and Le\u00f3n, Extremadura, the Basque Country and Catalonia, the figure is as low as 5%.\nWorse still, often the regulation doesn\u2019t work, says Ana Laforga, an independent environmental consultant. For building work on a house or a small shop with a budget of \u20ac500,000, the waste-management fee could be as little as \u20ac150, she explains.\nSources from the Ministry of Ecological Transition confirm that Spain is facing disciplinary proceedings from the European Union for failing to meet the Waste Framework Directive, due to its poor management of construction waste.\n\u201cThe reality today is that only one-fourth of construction and demolition waste in Spain ends up in the hands of an authorized waste-management company,\u201d says Garc\u00eda. This waste is recycled very efficiently, with up to 90% used to make new building materials. But the 75% that does not make it to the recycling plant ends up in old mining shafts, or in illegal dumps that pollute the mountains, valleys and coasts of the Iberian peninsula.\nFor the recycling companies, \u201cwhat is most serious and worrying is the existence of illegal commercial dumps, which charge to get rid of untreated waste, because as well as an environmental crime it is unfair competition.\u201d\nThis year, the Galicia Association of Construction and Demolition Waste Recyclers (ARCODEGA), reported the management company MV Gesti\u00f3n for environmental crime, accusing the business of dumping mixed, untreated waste in an enormous mining shaft in Lugo, in the northwestern region of Galicia. ARCODEGA maintains that this case is just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d when it comes to poor waste management in Spain.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/29/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
