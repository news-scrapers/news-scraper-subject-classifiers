The disturbances last night were particularly virulent, in terms of their duration, intensity and use of violence on the part of protestors, who were very aggressive toward the police.\nViolent groups surrounded the central headquarters of the National Police in the Catalan capital, throwing objects, putting up barricades and setting fire to trash containers. As the sun set, the protests moved to the center of the city, where the regional police force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, used an armored vehicle with a water cannon. At least three police officers were injured in the rioting.\nEarlier in the day, five massive marches of demonstrators had descended on Barcelona from different parts of Catalonia, also to protest the Supreme Court ruling, and coinciding with a general strike that had been called in the region by unions. That massive march, which local authorities said attracted more than half a million people, passed off peacefully. But once again, violence ended up tarnishing another day in Barcelona.\nProtestors threw fireworks, bottles and paint at police officers and their vehicles, while the police themselves tried to gain ground in order to avoid a full-on attack on their headquarters. The youngsters were mostly wearing hoods and had their faces covered, while some wore crash helmets and protective goggles.\nSaqueada una oficina bancaria en Ronda Sant Pere.

One of these objects hit an officer, who was left unconscious and had to be evacuated from the scene by his colleagues. The demonstrators also set fire to trash containers and created improvised bonfires.\nBy 8pm the police had managed to push the youngsters toward Urquinaona square, which became a new scene for the confrontations. The protestors used construction material, planters and trash containers to create barricades, and once again threw stones, cans and bottles at officers.\nDIRECTO | As\u00ed est\u00e1 la situaci\u00f3n ahora mismo en Via Laietana en Barcelona, en el quinto d\u00eda de protestas tras la sentencia del 'proc\u00e9s' https://t.co/y48Bqd8dTm pic.twitter.com/LAhqZzP4GU\n\u201cThe situation right now in Via Laietana in Barcelona, on the fifth day of protests after the sentence.\u201d\nThe police used rubber bullets, smoke grenades and tear gas to try to disperse the crowds, but these measures proved insufficient. That was when, for the first time this week, the Mossos resorted to the use of an armored vehicle \u2013 first, to remove rubble from the sidewalk, and then to employ the water cannon against the demonstrators.\nShortly before midnight, the large crowds had dissolved, but smaller groups of youngsters continued to cause altercations throughout the center, in a game of cat and mouse that has been seen nearly every night this week.\nOn Monday, hours after the Supreme Court sentence had been made public, the target chosen by the demonstrators was Barcelona\u2019s El Prat airport, resulting in spectacular scenes that were designed to draw the attention of the world. There were confrontations between protestors and the authorities, and the response from the Mossos and the National Police was resounding.\nOn Tuesday, the protestors targeted the central government\u2019s delegations in the region, which they described as a symbol of the \u201coppressive\u201d Spanish state. On Wednesday and Thursday, the disturbances \u2013 organized and led by groups of revolutionary and anarchist pro-independence supporters, and backed by young students \u2013 spread out of control throughout the center of Barcelona. That was when the rioting began to particularly focus on the police, whatever the color of their uniform.\nLos manifestantes lanzan pirotecnia y l\u00e1ser contra la l\u00ednea policial @policia #VagaGeneral #Barcelona #SentenciaDelProces Guerrilla urbana en Urquinaona pic.twitter.com/1QhaRkpiOr\n\u201cDemonstrators throw fireworks and aim laser beams at the police line.\u201d\nThe targeting of the authorities reached a critical point on Friday, when thousands of youngsters surrounded the National Police headquarters in Barcelona for seven hours, with violent incidents registered in the heart of the city when night came. Along with the Civil Guard, it was National Police officers who were responsible for the violence seen on October 1, 2017, when the Spanish authorities were charged with stopping the illegal referendum on Catalan independence from going ahead. These incidents, which were seen around the world, served to feed the hostility in the region toward the National Police.\nThe incidents on Friday left 182 injured across the region, 152 of them in Barcelona, and 83 arrests. At least three officers were injured after being hit by projectiles.\nAs the violent scenes played out, the regional premier, hardline pro-independence supporter Quim Torra, once again opted not to condemn the protests. Unlike earlier in the week, he did not take part in pro-independence marches on Friday, instead holding long meetings with his colleagues. The entire opposition in the Catalan parliament called for his resignation over his silence. \u201cWhere is the president?\u201d asked the leader of the Catalan Socialist Party (PSC), Miquel Iceta. The regional interior minister, Miquel Buch, did make a statement at 9.30pm, attributing the incidents of \u201cextreme violence\u201d to \u201corganized groups,\u201d and calling on citizens to \u201cisolate\u201d them.\nYesterday, the caretaker interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, explained that this week\u2019s troubles in Catalonia had seen 207 officers injured, 128 violent protestors arrested, 800 trash containers torched and 100 vehicles damaged.\nWith reporting by Alfonso L. Congostrina and Rebeca Carranco.\nAlbert Garcia, an EL PA\u00cdS photographer, was released at around 3.30am on Saturday after having been arrested by the National Police during last night\u2019s violent scenes in Barcelona. Garcia, who was clearly displaying his press accreditation, was immobilized by half-a-dozen officers and taken to a police van.\nThe arrest took place at around 10.30pm on the corner of Sant Pere and Pau Claris streets, according to a number of journalists who witnessed the incident. Garcia, who was wearing a crash helmet and protective goggles, was taking pictures of the arrest of a youngster when he was arrested, the same witnesses reported. The officers handcuffed Garcia and tried to avoid his colleagues from recording the detention, as can be seen in videos shared on social networks.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/19/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
