The reality is somewhat different \u2013 the Spanish it turns out are far from the worst drivers on the road, according to the annual survey carried out by the Spanish Royal Automobile Club (RACE) in collaboration with the Association of Drinks and Refreshments and with the support of Spain\u2019s DGT traffic authority.\nAs many as 43.5% of Europeans admit to driving after drinking alcohol\nThe survey focuses largely on fatigue at the wheel but includes other issues like driving under the influence, allowing for a fairly accurate profile of drivers of both sexes between the ages of 18 and 75, drawn from 3,368 online interviews from drivers 15 countries: Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland.\nSpain has dropped to eighth place regarding road fatalities, with 39 deaths for every million inhabitants, which ranks it below the European average of 51 per million.\nSweden has the lowest road fatality rate with 25 deaths per million residents, followed by Britain (27) and Denmark (32). At the other end of the spectrum, Romania tops the list with 99 fatalities for every million residents, followed by Bulgaria (89) and Croatia (80).\nAccording to the survey, 90.1% of Europeans use the car regularly. Spaniards score above average in this respect with 91% regularly using the car, while 97% of Italians are frequent drivers. Regarding purpose, 78.9% of Europeans use their vehicle for leisure, while 11.6% use it for professional reasons, figures that are similar to those in Spain.\nThe Spanish make an average of 11.7 trips of over 200 kilometers a year \u2013 or more precisely, an average of 356 kilometers \u2013 meaning they cover 4,165 kilometers a year with respect to long journeys. The Swedes travel the furthest in their cars, covering an average of 5,159 kilometers on these kinds of trips. And although shared car platforms are gaining popularity, 64.4% of Europeans still use their own vehicles for travel \u2013 72.8% in Spain \u2013 despite this being more expensive than other options.\nOnce on the road, Spanish drivers take a break on average two hours and seven minutes into the journey, putting them in fourth position while the Portuguese rank at the top, stopping after one hour and 45 minutes, and the Swiss and Austrians rank at the bottom, driving an average of two hours and 13 minutes on the road before resting. In Spain, the stops last between 10 and 15 minutes on 34% of occasions, which is less than the average in 11 of the surveyed countries, but behind Finland, Poland and Great Britain.\nFinland is the country with the highest number of accidents caused by driver fatigue\nMeanwhile, 5.2% of Europeans recognize that they almost always fall asleep on a long drive, a figure that drops to 2.3% in the case of Spain. Similarly concerning is the fact that 27% of Europeans admit that they don\u2019t stop for a break at all for stretches of up to four hours behind the wheel.\nWhere Spaniards are out ahead is in planning ahead for a long journey \u2013 with 83% preparing for the trip, 78.6% getting a reasonable amount of rest before setting off, 64.7% aiming to drive when traffic is less intense and 29.5% sharing the driving. In all respects, they score above the European average.\nFinland is country with the highest number of accidents caused by driver fatigue (24.7%), while Portugal has the lowest rate (4.9%), and Spain ranks eleventh with 10.8%. The profile in these kinds of accident is a male driver between 18 and 24, who drives only now and again, travels for work, has not had sufficient rest after more than four hours at the wheel and takes breaks lasting no longer than five minutes.\nAlcohol consumption continues to be a serious problem for road safety. As many as 43.5% of Europeans admit to driving after drinking alcohol, with 22% always or almost always driving after consumption. In Spain, 14.4% always or almost always drive under the influence while this figure rises to 27.5% in Britain and 32.9% in France. The most responsible in this respect are Czechs drivers with only 6.3% regularly drink driving.\nThe RACE study winds up by listing some telltale signs that drivers should heed with regard to weariness at the wheel \u2013 cramps, a sensation of numbness in limbs, itchy eyes and blurred vision, dehydration and a sensation of drifting off.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/12/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
