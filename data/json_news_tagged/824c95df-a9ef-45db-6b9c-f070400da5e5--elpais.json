According to data from Spain\u2019s National Statistics Institute (INE), a total of 9.9 million foreign tourists came to the country in that month, which represents a 1.3% fall on the same period in 2018. This is the second consecutive year that the figure has fallen in July, and is mostly down to reduced visits from Spain\u2019s two main markets: the United Kingdom and Germany.\nMeanwhile, tourist spending continued to rise. Visitors to the country from abroad spent \u20ac11.98 billion on their journeys to Spain, 2% up on July of last year, and with an average daily spend per tourist of \u20ac160, a 4.9% rise on last year\u2019s figure.\nVisitors to the country from abroad spent \u20ac11.98 billion on their journeys to Spain, 2% up on July of last year\nLast year, the reduction in visits was partly down to a heatwave at the beginning of summer, which saw many Central European tourists stay in their countries and delay their vacations. This year, a fresh heatwave at the end of July appears to have had the same effect. What\u2019s more, Turkey, Egypt and Tunisia are offering beach destinations at prices that are, in general, more competitive than Spain\u2019s. Brexit, as the UK\u2019s impending exit from the European Union is known, a slowdown in the UK economy and the threat of recession in Germany have also made consumers more sensitive to the prices of Spanish beach and sun trips.\nJuly saw a total of 2.16 million Britons visit Spain, 2.2% down on last year. Last year\u2019s figure represented a 2.6% fall on July 2017. That means that in two years, 161,000 fewer British tourists have visited Spain, with the fall for the year so far at 1.6%. In the second case, 143,000 fewer German tourists came in July of this year compared to the same month in 2017. This July saw 1.24 million visitors, 3% down on last year\u2019s figure. The reduced number of visits had its effect on Spanish hotels, with 11.8% fewer overnight stays among German tourists, albeit with a 1.2% increase for Britons.\nIn general, the falls have been mostly seen among Central European tourists, such as Belgians (-2%), Dutch (-4.82%) and Swiss (-8.6%). Meanwhile, visits grew among the French (2.3%, up to 1.4 million), Irish (6.7%) and Russians (5.21%).\nTourists from the United States came in at 429,666 in July, 19.8% up on a year ago. In the year so far, nearly two million Americans have visited Spain, 14.24% up on the same period in 2018.\nIn total, Spain received 9.88 million foreign tourists in July, 133,199 fewer than the year before (-1.3%) and 606,391 fewer than in July 2017, which was the best month of July on record. However, the numbers for this year so far are still an improvement on the same period in 2018: 48.06 tourist visits in total, which is 1.9% up on the first seven months of last year.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/02/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
