The new initiative, which will come into effect in 2020, will allow cars currently banned from the city center to enter the low-emissions zone, see parking fees reduced and give more parking space to motorcycles.\nMadrid Central was introduced by the former leftist administration of Mayor Manuela Carmena at the end of 2018. The pioneering initiative made 472 hectares of the city center off-limits to traffic, except for local residents and public transportation. Air pollution in the city center fell to \u201chistoric lows\u201d in June, after fines began to be issued for vehicles that violated the low-emissions zone, according to the environmental group Ecologists in Action.\nIn 2022, the traffic restrictions will be extended to the entire area within the M-30 ring road\nBut Madrid Central was heavily opposed by the conservative Popular Party (PP) and center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens), which campaigned against the plan in the lead up to the May 20 local elections. When the two parties formed a local coalition government in June, thanks to the votes of the far-right party Vox, the new mayor of Madrid, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida of the PP, announced that fines for violating drivers would be suspended \u2013 a decision that was soon overturned by the courts.\nAlmeida today presented Madrid 360, which he says aims to \u201creconcile air quality with social progress.\u201d Under the plan, vehicles carrying two or more people that have a C environmental sticker (modern diesel and gasoline cars) \u2013 which are currently banned from Madrid Central \u2013 will be allowed to enter the low-emissions zone. Business owners will be able to drive into Madrid Central with the same permissions as residents. The number of parking spaces for motorbikes will nearly double to 21,000, and motorcyclists will be able to enter the city center during a wider time frame.\nThe cost of parking will also be cut: electric cars will be able to park for free, ECO (hybrid vehicles) will pay half price, and cars with C stickers will receive a 10% discount. The number of parking spots for non-residents will also be increased.\nThe initiative plans to gradually ban the most-polluting vehicles from the city center, with cars without an environmental sticker to be prohibited from entering the low-emissions zone from 2021.\nIn 2022, the traffic restrictions will be extended to the entire area within the M-30 ring road, and in 2023 to the ring road itself, with the exception of residents. In 2024, the rules will be extended across the municipality and in 2025, residents will also be subject to the traffic restrictions. In other words, no car without an environmental sticker will be able to drive through the city.\nAccording to Almeida, the local government \u201cis aiming to absorb three times as many emissions as Madrid Central.\u201d To achieve this goal, Madrid City Hall plans to substitute gas and coal-fired burners, introduce new tactics to manage polluting gases, as well as two free zero-emission bus lines: between the Metro stations San Bernardo and Puerta de Toledo, and between Moncloa and Felipe II.\nBut Almeida warned that Madrid 360 also plans to \u201creorder cycling itineraries and get rid of bicycle lanes that hinder traffic.\u201d\nThe new plan has come under attack by Ecologists in Action, which says it is \u201cdangerous\u201d to allow C-sticker vehicles to enter the low-emissions zone. \u201cThese cars represent 36% of circulating traffic, meaning this measure is clearly negative and going to increase traffic a lot instead of reducing it,\u201d said Paco Segura, the spokesperson for Ecologists in Action.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/30/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
