When Britain voted to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum, most EU residents in the UK were unprepared for the result \u2013 like Mar from Madrid, who was in the middle of moving with her family to London.\n\u201cSince we arrived three years ago, things haven\u2019t gone badly for us. We have jobs and our two children [who are in a public school] already speak perfect English,\u201d says Mar, an executive secretary married to a chef, who preferred not to give her surname. \u201cIf in the end we have to pack our bags, we will simply go somewhere else,\u201d she says, determined not to let herself become overwhelmed by the inflexible position of the Boris Johnson government.\nAlthough Mar moved to London under the cloud of Brexit, at the time there was a strong idea that good sense would put an end to the process. The British government of Theresa May smashed this hope. And the ensuing Johnson administration has since threatened to end freedom of movement for EU citizens immediately after a potential no-deal Brexit on November 1.\nMar does not want to speculate whether Johnson is just bluffing in order to win new concessions from Brussels. She has followed the steps recommended by the British Home Secretary in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and applied for recognition as a legal resident. She has been granted this status, but that\u2019s not the end of the story. EU citizens in the UK have to show they have been living in the country for at least five years to obtain \u201csettled status.\u201d Those who, like Mar, do not pass the five-year benchmark, must first request \u201cpre-settled status,\u201d and can only apply to for \u201csettled status\u201d once they have lived in the country for five years. In both cases, EU residents will be allowed to work in the UK and use, among other public services, the National Health System (NHS). The deadline to file these applications will be extended until December 2020.\nEU citizens have to show they have been living in the UK for at least five years to be granted \u201csettled status\u201d\nBut there are still a lot of unanswered questions that are making EU citizens anxious and confused. For instance, organizations in defense of EU rights such as 3 Million and Imix, ask: who will control who is and who is not a legal resident? Will it fall to medical services, home owners or businesses?\nIn the United Kingdom, there is no such thing as a physical national identity card (a driver\u2019s license or credit card is usually used as ID), and there are no plans to provide non-British residents with a special document. It is also unclear what kind of documentation will be required of a person from Spain, France or Bulgaria who decides to visit their home country and return to Britain after October 31.\nR\u00e1ul Garc\u00eda Lax, who is from Murcia, has worked as a hairdresser in London for 14 years, and he is not going to start any bureaucratic process until the British authorities in charge of issuing residency certificates \u201care clear\u201d about what exactly is required. Lax will have no problem getting approved (\u201cI have a social security number, and I own a houseboat in the canal\u201d) but he is frustrated that the application is only compatible with Android cellphones, an issue that has also been criticized by 3 Million and Imix.\nTo date, one million EU citizens have successfully completed the process to regularize their status as residents in the case of a possible hard Brexit. But another 2.5 million EU nationals remain. Before summer, Dani Lozano, from Catalonia, received an internal memo from the bank where he works, which recommended its EU employees apply for settled status. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to waste time until something concrete happens,\u201d he says, be that a soft or a hard Brexit, or no Brexit at all. His wife, Laura Jim\u00e9nez, who also works in the financial sector, changed her mind after Johnson\u2019s threat and will be applying for settled status on August 31, which marks five years since the couple arrived in London.\nIf they don\u2019t want me here where I pay my taxes, I will go wherever it suits me\nHairdresser R\u00e1ul Garc\u00eda Lax\nSilvia Gonz\u00e1lez L\u00f3pez, from Le\u00f3n, is the head of a recycling service at Newport City Hall and after living in the UK for four years should have no trouble getting pre-settled status. Her husband was granted it during a trial phrase that was pushed forward for higher education professionals. But Silvia is reluctant to apply, given that she will have to start the process again \u201cfrom scratch,\u201d once she has met the five-year benchmark, in order to request settled status. She also worries the application is not covered by the data protection law.\nSpeaking with EL PA\u00cdS, Silvia says that it is a \u201cpersonal decision,\u201d which will not affect someone like herself with a stable job who contributes to the British social security system. But she is concerned that other EU nationals, like members of the Romanian community, as well as elderly and sick people who don\u2019t know how to navigate the application process, are being left by the wayside or don\u2019t realize that \u201cthe last train [for an orderly exit from the EU] left in March 2019.\u201d\n\u201cBefore Brexit, I felt more integrated,\u201d admits Lax, who says he was once told to \u201cgo home\u201d in a bar. He tries to ignore the strange mood stirred up by Brexit, and is convinced he will be able to continue his life in the UK, regardless of the final outcome. \u201cBut if in the end they don\u2019t want me here, where I pay my taxes, I will go wherever it suits me,\u201d he says defiantly.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/27/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
