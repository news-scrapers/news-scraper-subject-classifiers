That\u2019s according to the latest poll released today by the public CIS research insistute.\nAccording to the most favorable data from the survey for caretaker Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the PSOE would emerge from the general election with an absolute majority of 176 seats if he had the support of the left-wing anti-austerity Unidas Podemos bloc. He could also, according to the survey, achieve an absolute majority with the seats of center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens).\nThe survey was done before the Supreme Court ruling on the Catalan separatists\nThe November vote will be the fourth general election in Spain in four years, with the last taking place as recently as April. That poll saw S\u00e1nchez win the most seats \u2013 a total of 123 \u2013 but fall short of a majority. Months of negotiations to form a government with the key support of Unidas Podemos eventually came to nothing, while other parties \u2013 including Ciudadanos \u2013 refused to even consider supporting the PSOE.\nThis latest survey was carried out between September 21 and October 13, which is before the Supreme Court ruling that jailed nine pro-Catalan independence leaders was released. That judgment prompted days of protests and sometimes violent disturbances across Catalonia. The polling was also completed before the PSOE\u2019s plan to exhume former Spanish dictator Francisco Franco from the Valley of the Fallen monument was completed. Internally, the PSOE believes that finally removing Franco from his resting place will be a vote winner on November 10.\nThe latest CIS poll is the best result that the PSOE has seen in the recent surveys. The conservative Popular Party (PP), meanwhile, which saw its worst result ever at the April 28 general election, is predicted to take 18.1% of the vote, according to the survey released today. This would be an improvement on the last election, and would give them between 74 and 81 deputies in Congress.\nUnidas Podemos would come in third place with 14.6% of the vote, and between 37 and 45 seats in Congress, a similar result to the 42 seats it took in the April election. And Ciudadanos would come in fourth with 10.6% of the vote, and between 14 and 21 seats in Congress. In April it won 57 seats at the ballot boxes.\nFar-right Vox is predicted by the CIS poll to take 7.9% of the vote, which would give it between 14 and 21 seats \u2013 in April it took 24.\nToday\u2019s survey was based on 17,650 interviews, carried out in 1,091 municipalities in 50 provinces, as well as Spain\u2019s North African cities Ceuta and Melilla. The margin of error is plus or minus 0.75% for the entire sample.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/29/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
