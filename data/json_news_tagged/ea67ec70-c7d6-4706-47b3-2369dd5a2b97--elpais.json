The vessel has been at sea for 19 days, and, after rescuing 150 or so migrants, has now been moored off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa since Friday.\nThey cannot ask us to act as taxis and take the migrants to a Spanish port when we are 800 meters away from a safe port\n\u00d3scar Camps, Proactiva Open Arms founder\n\u201cAfter analyzing a number of different options, the Spanish government, in accordance with the logistic recommendations of the Navy, believes that this one is the most appropriate and will allow for the resolution this week of the humanitarian emergency on board,\u201d the acting Socialist Party administration announced via a statement on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe Navy ship Audaz will set sail at 5pm from the Rota naval base in C\u00e1diz, southwestern Spain, once preparations have been made. Medical staff and psychologists will also be on board to treat the migrants as they are brought to Spain. The journey to the Italian island will take three days, and the government is proposing that the migrants not only board the Navy vessel, but also that\u00a0it accompany the Open Arms \u201cto the port of Palma,\u201d on the Balearic Island of Mallorca.\nConditions on the Open Arms have continued to deteriorate, with eight migrants requiring an urgent medical evacuation on Monday night. \u201cWhoever cannot see that the situation on board is unsustainable is incapable of feeling another person\u2019s pain,\u201d the NGO Proactiva Open Arms, which runs the ship, stated after the evacuation, which included one accompanying migrant.\nThe situation worsened on Tuesday, after one of the migrants, a Syrian man, jumped over the side of the boat and was rescued by the Italian Coast Guard, which took him to shore where he was collected by an ambulance.\nSeveral hours later, nine more of the migrants followed his example, and earlier this afternoon another five did the same. All of them were rescued by the Coast Guard or by speedboats from the Open Arms. Five of them were taken to the shore.\n\u201cMore people have jumped into the water from the Open Arms to try to swim to Lampedusa,\u201d the NGO reported. \u201cThe situation on the vessel is critical.\u201d\nToday\u2019s incidents were repeats of those seen on Sunday morning, when four migrants jumped ship and tried to swim to the coast.\nItaly has refused to allow the rescue ship to dock at its ports, even though six European countries, including Spain, had offered to take in the rescued migrants.\nOn Sunday, Spain\u2019s acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, of the Socialist Party (PSOE), offered the Open Arms the southern port of Algeciras in C\u00e1diz, and Mah\u00f3n in Menorca in the Balearic Islands. But Proactiva Open Arms refused the offer, arguing it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to attempt the four- to six-day journey given the conditions on board.\nWhoever cannot see that the situation on board is unsustainable is incapable of feeling another person\u2019s pain\nProactiva Open Arms\nItaly\u2019s transport minister, Danilo Toninelli, had said Italy would transport the migrants to a Spanish port on Coast Guard ships, if Spain refused to allow the Open Arms to sail under the Spanish flag, meaning it would technically be immobilized until it found another flag to fly under.\n\u201cWe have been waiting for a solution for 18 days, and now we find out that the Spanish and Italian governments have reached an agreement, telling us it is better to go to Spain, that Spain offers its ports and the Italian Coast Guard its ships to escort us. I find it surreal,\u201d \u00d3scar Camps, the founder of the Barcelona-based NGO, told EL PA\u00cdS in Lampedusa on Tuesday morning, before news broke that the Spanish Navy would be sending a vessel.\nSeven months ago, the Spanish government banned the NGO Proactiva Open Arms from completing rescue missions in the central Mediterranean Sea, on the basis that the Open Arms was not equipped to carry out long journeys.\n\u201cNow they are asking us to do the opposite,\u201d argued Camps. \u201cThat we ignore the office that banned us from transporting people and go to Spain [...] without secure conditions or health guarantees. And violating [the migrants\u2019] rights, because they would be going in overcrowded conditions.\n\u201cWe are a very small organization,\u201d he added. \u201cThey cannot ask us to act as taxis and take [the migrants] to a Spanish port when we are 800 meters away from a safe port. Especially since Spain has offered a guarantee to Italy that it would take responsibility for them.\u201d\nAs an alternative solution, Camps suggested that the migrants be allowed to dock in Lampedusa, where they would stay temporarily, until a plane could transport them to Spain, \u201cwhich would cost a lot less than a sea transfer.\u201d\nBut the government\u2019s delegate in Catalonia, Teresa Cunillera, had maintained that \u201cthe ball is not in the government\u2019s court.\u201d In an interview with Radio Catalunya, she said: \u201cSpain offered its ports 36 hours ago and the ship hasn\u2019t moved.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Pablo Casado, the leader of the conservative Popular Party (PP), said on Tuesday that S\u00e1nchez\u2019s handling of the situation would encourage more irregular immigration. \u201cOur concern is that, with the poor handling of the Open Arms crisis, mafias will see Spain as a country that receives any type of ship, where unfortunate migrants are exploited by mafias, risking their lives trying to improve their conditions,\u201d he said.\nMar\u00eda Eugenia Rodr\u00edguez Palop, a member of the European Parliament for the anti-austerity party Podemos, has also criticized the government for responding \u201ctoo late\u201d to the crisis.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson and Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/20/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
