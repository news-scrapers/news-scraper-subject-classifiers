A local woman said that this particular resident is \u201cvery committed to animal rights,\u201d and \u201cregularly attends marches against bullfighting.\u201d There is nothing in Spain\u2019s electoral legislation specifically prohibiting voting officials from showing up in this kind of attire. \u201cAt least he won\u2019t be so cold,\u201d said the woman with a laugh. The capital of Soria province (also named Soria) routinely ranks as one of Spain\u2019s coldest cities, and in some parts of the province residents have had trouble reaching their polling stations due to the falling snow.\nEl presidente de mesa de un colegio electoral de Burgo de Osma (Soria) se ha presentado vestido con un disfraz de oso https://t.co/LkT4HHmwfo pic.twitter.com/8b0eBcIJmT\nThe president of the voting station at Burgo de Osma (Soria) showed up in a bear outfit.\nThere was more dressing up in other parts of Spain. A group of fans of the fantasy movie franchise Star Wars showed up in full gear at Seville\u2019s Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez school, although they did remove their helmets and hoods when it was time for them to cast their votes. People around them seemed mildly surprised, Spanish news agency EFE reported.\nHoy hay elecciones en Espa\u00f1a. Una amiga en Sevilla me pasa fotos que public\u00f3 el ABC de la jornada en esa ciudad... donde vot\u00f3 Palpatine y su guardial imperial. La galer\u00eda de las votaciones, con las cosas serias: https://t.co/9tuZW9dv7P(Hab\u00eda una convenci\u00f3n Star Wars cerca) pic.twitter.com/FLRTieNuLK\nToday there are elections in Spain. A friend in Seville sent me photos published in ABC of the election day in this city, where Palpatine and his imperial guard voted. (There was a \u2018Star Wars\u2019 convention nearby.\nThe eight registered residents of Villarroya, located around 60 kilometers from Logro\u00f1o, in the small winemaking region of La Rioja, have managed to beat their own record: they voted in 32 seconds and 25 hundredths of a second, making it the first locality in Spain to close its one and only polling station. The mayor, Salvador P\u00e9rez, told the news agency Europa Press that many of the voters had to be there at 8am anyway because they were acting as voting officials. \u201cSo it was easier to have everyone here on time and break the record,\u201d he said. Villarroya has held this title for years, although its previous best time was 40 seconds.\nOn a tragic note, an elderly woman died after fainting and falling to the ground as she was preparing to vote in V\u00e9lez de Benaudalla, in the Andalusian province of Granada. And an 87-year-old man from Urretxu, in the Basque province of Guip\u00fazcoa, died of a heart attack at his polling station, which was closed for over an hour, according to the Interior Ministry.\nA voting official in Ourense, in the northwestern region of Galicia, arrived late and without his ID card, which he claimed had been eaten by his dog. The man was relieved from his duties after a substitute was called in, EFE reported. Voting officials are chosen at random from the voter census, and selected citizens have a duty to serve, unless they are able to provide a compelling reason why they cannot do so.\nSnow caused a 90-minute delay at a polling station in Urri\u00e9s, in Zaragoza province, where a voting official was unable to show up at 8am. In Caspe, a locksmith had to be called in to deal with a polling station door lock that had been sealed with silicone. And two voting officials in Zaragoza complained that they didn\u2019t get along, although this did not free them from their duty to jointly man the voting desk.\nThere were tense exchanges between party representatives acting as election observers for the far-right Vox and the anti-austerity Podemos in Logro\u00f1o, in La Rioja. Vox member Adri\u00e1n Belaza, who once ran for mayor, said on Twitter that a Podemos representative \u201calerted the police so that we would cut out the national flag from our accreditation, claiming it was electioneering. Even the police couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\nEn un colegio electoral de Logro\u00f1o un apoderado de @ahorapodemos ha avisado a la @policia para que recort\u00e1ramos la bandera nacional de nuestra acreditaci\u00f3n argumentando electoralismo. Incluso la polic\u00eda no daba cr\u00e9dito. \u2705Por esto necesitamos a VOX \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8#10N#Elecciones10N pic.twitter.com/fQRKKIWI0E\nIn a polling station in Logro\u00f1o, a Podemos member alerted police so that we would cut out the national flag from our accreditation, arguing it was electioneering. Even the police couldn\u2019t believe it.\nThe Catalan premier, the separatist Quim Torra, voted on Sunday at a polling station where one of his daughters was acting as a voting official. Torra\u2019s daughter was wearing a yellow sweatshirt, yellow being the color adopted by the independence movement in Catalonia.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/10/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
