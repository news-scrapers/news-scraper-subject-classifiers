The mystery of the dismembered child in El Castillo cave\n\nEnigmatic marks found on the jaw of a five-year-old child have rekindled a paleontological mystery that has been puzzling experts for more than a century.\nThe indentations on the bone indicate that the child\u2019s tongue was pulled out with sharp stone implements after his death, perhaps to be eaten or as part of a funeral ritual carried out in El Castillo cave in Cantabria, which is part of Spain\u2019s famous Altamira caves, and features some of the oldest prehistoric paintings in Europe.\nCannibalism is very common, in our species as well as in previous eras\nResearcher Palmira Saladi\u00e9\nThe remains of the small boy were found in 1912 by the German paleontologist Hugo Obermaier, whose team was the first to embark on a systematic excavation of the cave. Obermaier and his colleagues did not, however, give much importance to this fragment of the boy\u2019s lower jaw. Two years after it was found, the First World War broke out and they never returned to the site. The human fragment of bone, which was initially kept in the Prehistoric Museum of Cantabria, was lent out and subsequently lost.\nIn 2016, a team of paleontologists managed to track down the fossil, which appeared among the personal belongings of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Basabe, a Basque paleoanthropologist who died in 1985. After recovering the fragment, researchers saw that some of the teeth had been roughly pulled out in an unsuccessful effort to extract the DNA.\nThe latest study of the bone fragment is the first to produce reliable data on the child\u2019s identity and the events surrounding his death. The report, published in the American Association of Physical Anthropologist magazine, analyzes the notebooks written by Obermaier during his excavation of the Cantabrian cave, which are kept in the archives of the National Archeological Museum.\nThe researchers found that, alongside the remains of the child, Obermaier and his crew had also discovered small fragments of a cranium and the teeth of two other people \u2013 a well-built adult and a young person. The analysis of the child\u2019s bone suggests he was a Homo Sapiens, though with more primitive features such as bigger teeth and a smaller chin typical of the era. The researchers extracted a sample of bone and, using Carbon 14 dating technology, showed that the child lived around 27,000 years ago, possibly when some of the cave paintings were done, particularly the silhouettes of hands in ochre, according to Federico Bernaldo de Quir\u00f3s, who co-authored the study along with anthropologist Mar\u00eda Dolores Garralda. Uranium dating has indicated that some of the paintings date back 40,000 years, while the most recent were probably done some 15,000 years ago.\n\u201cEl Castillo has a massive main hall, around 20 meters wide, followed by a second large chamber which is where the paintings are,\u201c says Bernaldo. \u201cThis was a perfect place for meetings and socializing and different groups would have lived together here for periods, socializing and sharing. We have found the bones of almost 200 deer that were hunted at the same time.\u201d\nThe boy found in El Castillo belonged to the Upper Paleolithic Gravettian culture that spread across Europe 30,000 years ago\nThe first to come to the cave would have been Neanderthals approximately 200,000 years ago. Since then, there are signs of intermittent human occupation, which also included Sapiens, who continued to come until the Bronze Age, 5,000-odd years ago.\nAt that time, there was no shortage of food. There were plenty of animals for hunting and there was also fish to be had from nearby rivers. The analysis of the jaw shows that the child had a varied diet. So why would they want to eat him if they had more than enough food?\nThe boy found in El Castillo belonged to the Upper Paleolithic Gravettian culture that spread across Europe 30,000 years ago and lasted 10,000 years. \u201cThere are numerous burials from this period, some very humble, others extremely grand, such as the young man, found in Arene Candide, Italy, buried with a shell headdress, a huge dagger in his hand and red ochre covering his body, who is nicknamed \u2018The Prince\u2019,\u201d says Mar\u00eda Dolores Garralda, a professor at the Complutense University in Madrid.\nWhat is exceptional about the jaw fragment in Cantabria is that the indentations show that the body was tampered with shortly after death in order for the tongue to be extracted, according to Garralda. \u201cThere is no way of knowing why they did this,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt is the only clear case of such a practice in Western Europe, along with another recent find in France.\u201d\nIn Eastern Europe, on the Crimean Peninsula, the discovery of scarred skulls has suggested dismemberment, a practice experts attribute to a funereal ritual.\n\u201cWe think it is more probable that there was a ritual or symbolic significance in El Castillo, whether or not there was cannibalism,\u201d says Garralda. \u201cIt could have been a burial that was subsequently dug up by hyenas.\u201d\nAccording to Palmira Saladi\u00e9, researcher at the Institute of Human Paleoecology and an expert in the study of cannibalism among the hominids of Atapuerca, the authors of the study are right to be cautious in their interpretation. \u201cIn most cases, the human remains from cannibalism are found together with a large amount of animal remains,\u201d she says. \u201cIn Atapuerca, there are many signs of cannibalism, especially of children. I understand it to have been a violent cannibalism. It was a very rich territory with lots of animals for hunting and this was probably a way of defending the territory from rival groups. It\u2019s something similar to what chimpanzees do. In general, cannibalism is very common, in our species as well as in previous eras. The problem is that we still know very little about why it happened.\u201d\nIt is the only clear case of such a practice in Western Europe, along with another recent find in France\nProfessor Mar\u00eda Dolores Garralda\nAccording to Mar\u00eda Martin\u00f3n, director of the National Research Center on Human Evolution (CENIEH), \u201cthe reconstruction of a story, as in a film, needs more than the actor; it needs a scene and other main characters or secondary roles \u2013 a context. Unfortunately, none of that has been conserved in the case of the child of El Castillo.\u201d\nSome context might have been provided by the remains of the other two humans found by Obermaier more than a century ago, but these have been lost and there is clue as to where they might be found, according to Beraldo.\nFor years the entrance to the El Castillo cave was used as a parking lot for visitors. In 1980, the team of archeologists behind the current research began to excavate. \u201cAlthough this has not yet been published, we have found human remains from the same era, but they are only the baby teeth of children, which doesn\u2019t tell us anything more about their funereal practices. So the mystery will probably remain,\u201d he says.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/22/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
