This crime was introduced into the Spanish penal code by a conservative government in the early 2000s in response to a referendum proposal by the Basque Country, but it was later repealed by a Socialist administration.\nS\u00e1nchez even accused the Popular Party (PP), which was in power in 2017, of being soft because it \u201callowed Puigdemont to get away,\u201d alluding to the former Catalan premier Carles Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium to avoid arrest after the unilateral independence declaration. He remains outside of the country and would be detained were he to return to Spanish shores.\nS\u00e1nchez made some overtures to leftist voters by promising to make it a crime to praise fascism, and pledging to shut down the Francisco Franco Foundation. The caretaker government recently made good on its promise to transfer the late dictator\u2019s body from the Valley of the Fallen mausoleum to a Madrid cemetery.\nWhile right-wing candidates mocked S\u00e1nchez for walking into their territory, Pablo Iglesias, the leader of the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos group, urged him not to abandon the leftist bloc, and to stop competing with the \u201cignorant and aggressive right that says there is no such thing as plurinational countries: Switzerland is a plurinational country, the UK is a plurinational country, and Spain is a plurinational country, and it\u2019s OK to say it.\u201d Iglesias insisted that the Catalan issue can only be solved through dialogue.\nMeanwhile, right-leaning candidates were conducting their own parallel fights. Pablo Casado of the PP spared Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera no criticism, telling him to stop giving him lessons about how to fight corruption, while the latter produced a piece of broken pavement from Barcelona \u2013 where there have been violent street protests following the sentencing of nine separatist leaders to prison for their role in the breakaway attempt \u2013 to illustrate \u201cthe threat to the rule of law.\u201d\nEL PA\u00cdS\nDuring the debate, Pedro S\u00e1nchez made a point of saying that if elected, he will appoint Nadia Calvi\u00f1o, currently the economy minister in his caretaker government, as the new deputy PM in charge of economic affairs. The pledge could be viewed as a message to Brussels that a Socialist Party administration will guarantee economic rigor and a contained deficit, as Calvi\u00f1o is a well-respected figure in the EU who has worked for the European Commission in several capacities, including Director-General for Budget.\nCasado also ruled out the possibility of a grand coalition between the PP and the PSOE, which would easily secure the required majority for a governing alliance according to the polls.\nSantiago Abascal, leader of the far-right Vox party, seemed more relaxed than any of the other nominees as he made promises to outlaw separatist parties, such as those leading the secessionist drive in Catalonia, and send the current premier of that region, Quim Torra, to prison. Overall, Abascal spent more time talking about immigration than about Catalonia or the economy. Polls suggest that his party could make great gains on Sunday to become the third-largest force in the Spanish parliament.\nS\u00e1nchez, for his part, accused both Casado and Rivera of representing \u201cthe cowardly right that stands before the aggressive far-right\u201d as represented by Vox.\nThe debate showcased how the PP and Ciudadanos are competing hard for votes but are still willing to craft governing coalitions with outside support from Vox, as they have already done in several regional governments. By contrast, a left-leaning alliance remains as elusive as it was after the April election. \u201cYou see, Mr S\u00e1nchez?\u201d said Iglesias. \u201cThe right argues a lot, but then it doesn\u2019t hesitate to enter into coalition governments.
