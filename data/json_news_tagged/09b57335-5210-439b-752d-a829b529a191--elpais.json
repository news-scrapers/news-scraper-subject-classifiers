A two-bedroom apartment with a large patio next to the old Vista Alegre bullring in the Carabanchel Bajo neighborhood of Madrid. Carmen Santamar\u00eda and her husband Sabas Carretero bought the place in 1954, and raised their seven children there, making do with Carretero\u2019s salary as an assistant in a clothing store. It was the only asset they had to hand down to their children. But as they got older the plan took an unexpected turn. Carmen, widowed, developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease and by 2014 her condition had deteriorated so much that her children decided to urgently place her in a nursing home.\nIn order to cover the monthly cost, they sold Carmen\u2019s property for just over \u20ac70,000. Her 56-year-old daughter, Pilar Carretero, says they had no choice but to let go of the home that held all of their memories: \u201cMy mother didn\u2019t even know.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a business. They want to make money wherever they can\nCarmen Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, daughter of nursing home resident\nCarmen now lives in one of the most affordable nursing homes in the Madrid region, in a center 41 kilometers southwest of the capital in El \u00c1lamo. They pay around \u20ac1,800 a month \u2013 the regional average is \u20ac1,900, according to the popular nursing home website Inforesidencias.com. This cost can be such a huge burden on families that many end up selling their properties and burning through their savings.\nLike most Madrile\u00f1os with family members in nursing homes, Pilar Carretero cannot afford the monthly fees with her mother\u2019s benefits and state aid alone. Her mother gets \u20ac600 from her widow\u2019s pension and \u20ac700 in dependent benefits. This money is supplemented by the proceeds from the sale of the apartment, but even these savings are slowly drying up.\nMany nursing home residents in Madrid are struggling with financial hardship, and it\u2019s a burden that weighs heavily on them. \u201cI have spoken to other residents who don\u2019t want to carry on living because they are running out of money,\u201d Carretero explains.\nOver recent years, the cost of nursing homes has risen faster than pensions and dependency benefits. In Madrid, the aged care sector has grown significantly, especially in the private sphere, which views Spain\u2019s aging population as a good business opportunity.\nTo address the escalating crisis, families and the Spanish Ombudsman\u2019s Office have called for more public support. \u201cThe nursing home business has gotten out of control,\u201d says Miguel V\u00e1zquez, a spokesman for Pladigmare, an association of people who have relatives in aged care facilities. \u201cWe\u2019re asking for a re-balancing of what\u2019s on offer in the public and private sectors.\u201d\nThe cost of nursing homes is likely to rise, after care workers recently won a pay rise during negotiations for a national collective agreement. But families are prepared to sacrifice a lot to ensure their loved ones get the best treatment in their final days, sometimes paying above their means.\nCarmen Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, a 63-year-old journalist, says that she and her brothers looked for a good nursing home for their mother, Amparo, who was ill with Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Soon they realized that, in a sector plagued by complaints about poor standards, they would only get what they wanted if they paid a \u201cfive-star\u201d price.\nThe cost of nursing homes has risen faster than pensions and dependency benefits\nFor 12 years, Amparo lived in the Ballesol Pr\u00edncipe de Vergara nursing home, which has five stars on its logo. The family paid \u20ac4,000 per month for a single room plus an extra \u20ac1,000 for a private carer. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez estimates that it cost them \u20ac500,000, which they covered by selling the family home in Madrid and another residence in the mountains.\nAmparo died on August 22 at the age of 95. Her daughter says the last bill they received from the home included the cost of the room for two days when her mother was no longer there, and for an electrocardiogram done after her death, which she was told was protocol.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a business. They want to make money wherever they can,\u201d Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez says. The nursing home declined to respond to this newspaper\u2019s request for comment.\nThere are alternatives to selling the family home, such as renting or reverse mortgages, which is a loan usually secured on a residential property that has to be paid back by those who inherit it. But in practice, this solution doesn\u2019t help with families of apartments in low-demand areas. Specialized companies such as Pensium, which guarantee a rental income from day one, only work with clients after a \u201crentability study.\u201d\n\u201cIn the end, if you don\u2019t have a suitable apartment, none of these options are of any use to you,\u201d says Josep de Mart\u00ed, director of the site Inforesidencias.com.\nThis is what happens to many Madrid-born children of immigrants, who have houses in inland Spain. The children of 95-year-old Josefa L\u00f3pez Flores tried desperately to sell the family home in Puente Genil, a small town in the province of C\u00f3rdoba in southern Spain. The cost of their mother\u2019s private nursing home, \u20ac2,350 a month, was eating up her savings. She was on a waiting list for a subsidized spot for three-and-a-half years, says her 70-year-old son Jos\u00e9 Ruiz.\nLuckily in May, Josefa was granted a subsidized room after her children were able to show that the financial situation had worsened. Ruiz considers himself lucky. \u201cThere are people who die waiting.\u201d\nEnglish version by Alicia Kember.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/25/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
