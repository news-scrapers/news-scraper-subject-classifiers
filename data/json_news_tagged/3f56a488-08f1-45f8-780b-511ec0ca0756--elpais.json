Everyone knew ahead of time what the others would say, who would submit to what is known in Spain as an \u201cinvestiture vote,\u201d and who would vote for and against the candidate.\nWhat seems least likely of all \u2013 although with Iglesias there are no certainties \u2013 is that Podemos\u2019s 35 lawmakers will vote in favor of S\u00e1nchez\nBut all that changed in 2016. That year\u00a0Pablo Iglesias, the leader of the leftist party Unidas Podemos, informed Felipe VI about an offer for a coalition government with the Socialist Party (PSOE) that the latter had not been told about.\nFast-forward to today. Neither one of Spain\u2019s four largest parties \u2013 PSOE, the Popular Party (PP), center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) and Unidas Podemos \u2013 really knows what the others will tell the monarch at a fresh round of talks that will be decisive: if no solid candidate emerges in the coming days, parliament will be dissolved next week and a repeat general election called for November 10. It would be the fourth in Spain in as many years.\nAnd while audiences are by now getting used to last-minute plot twists engineered by Pablo Iglesias, this time it was Albert Rivera of Ciudadanos who came up with an unexpected offer. On Monday, Rivera said his party could abstain at the investiture vote, as long as the PP does so as well, and only if the PSOE agrees to certain conditions involving taxes, the government in the northern Spanish region of Navarre and the Catalan separatist crisis.\nCiudadanos came in third at the April 28 election, and its 57 seats would be enough to help the PSOE \u2013 which has 123 lawmakers in Congress \u2013 to form a government. But Rivera had lately chosen to side with the conservative PP and the far-right Vox, explicitly shunning any deals with the Socialists.\nMeanwhile, Unidas Podemos\u2019s Iglesias on Monday announced that he is still planning to abstain even if the PP and Ciudadanos do so as well. This would guarantee that acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez can finally form a government, after failing at an earlier investiture vote held in July. Following Spanish electoral legislation, the candidate needs an absolute majority of votes in the first round, or failing that, a simple majority of more yes than no votes in a second round, meaning that abstentions play a key part.\nWhat seems least likely of all \u2013 although with Iglesias there are no certainties \u2013 is that Unidas Podemos\u2019s 35 lawmakers will vote in favor of S\u00e1nchez, making abstentions by other parties irrelevant. Iglesias and S\u00e1nchez have been at odds over the possibility of a coalition government, something that the former demands and the latter rejects.\nPlaying in S\u00e1nchez\u2019s favor is the fact that he will be the last political leader to meet with the king, at which point he will already know what all the others have said. In theory, he could save his own investiture by reaching a last-minute deal with either Unidas Podemos or with Ciudadanos and the PP.\nBut the time for agreements is coming to an end. Any investiture session will have to take place this weekend, before parliament is automatically dissolved on September 23 and a new election called for November 10.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/17/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
