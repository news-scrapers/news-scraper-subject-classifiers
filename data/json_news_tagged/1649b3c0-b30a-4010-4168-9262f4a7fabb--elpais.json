The cup was won due to collective effort; the vision was the product of boredom.\n\u201cOkay, so we won, but I also spent hours and hours staring at the ceiling,\u201d says the famous Bar\u00e7a center-back. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much more to do. You can\u2019t spend a month somewhere and do nothing but play soccer.\u201d\nThere were games of cards to while away the hours, and Piqu\u00e9 did win a lot of games of Pocha, staying up until 3am goaded on by the Spanish goalkeeper, Pepe Reina.\nBoredom is nothing if not productive for restless souls like Piqu\u00e9, who bounces a rubber ball while speaking at the headquarters of his company, Kosmos Global Holding. His average day consists of meetings as the head of his fledgling company, training sessions with Bar\u00e7a and picking up his two children Milan, six, and Sasha, four, from school. This is not an agenda everyone could cope with.\n\u201cSouth Africa was the start of a process that later mutated,\u201d he says, referring to the new format his company has come up with for the main international team event in men\u2019s tennis, the Davis Cup.\nPiqu\u00e9\u2019s new formula will debut on November 18 in Madrid\u2019s Caja M\u00e1gica. This is where the 119-year-old tournament, which has traditionally been played over the course of a year in a number of countries, will be condensed into a week of play in one place, boosting the dynamics.\nNot only is the tournament being revamped in terms of space and time, the matches themselves will be shorter, with just three sets played as opposed to five.\nCharging the spectacle with additional energy, Piqu\u00e9\u2019s wife Shakira will perform on the final day, November 24. Another bid to revive the tournament\u2019s popularity is to make the ticket price accessible at \u20ac25. \u201cThe Davis Cup is the people\u2019s competition in a sport that many consider to be elitist,\u201d says Piqu\u00e9. It needed a shake-up to revive it and reconnect it with a larger audience. This is something almost everyone in the tennis world agrees on, including the players and their fans.\nBut why should a soccer player like Gerard Piqu\u00e9 be the one to shake things up? As an outsider in the world of tennis, it might seem like a curious development. However, Piqu\u00e9 is a sportsman with business acumen.\nOnly 23 when the idea first occurred to him, Piqu\u00e9 is now 32 and seems to have matured, perhaps having learned from experience. His inspiration for the revamped Davis Cup was not incidental, but a product of his environment; a combination of excitement and idle time that led him to think: why not give the Davis Cup the same world cup status as the FIFA championship? The idea consumed him and gave him more than a few sleepless nights. \u201cI scarcely sleep four or five hours,\u201d he says. \u201cI lack time for everything.\u201d\nHe launched his initiative alongside his training sessions and matches, and everything else that playing for Bar\u00e7a entails. He\u2019s hyperactive, a character trait that his teammates have had to get\u00a0 used to. \u201cThey get it and there are no problems,\u201d he says. \u201cI spend my free time doing what I like doing.\u201d And that, in a word, means business.\nThe first thing he did after hatching the Davis Cup idea was to tell his father, Joan Piqu\u00e9. A successful Catalan businessman, Joan offered a reality check. \u201cIf others have tried and failed, why should you succeed?\u201d he asked his son, patting him on the back. \u201cHe panics with me, but then he supports me,\u201d says Gerard.\nAs Piqu\u00e9 is used to swimming against the tide \u2013 he actually thrives on overcoming obstacles and at times throws a few in his own path \u2013 his father\u2019s response acted as a catalyst and he set about proving him wrong.\nThe first step was to set up a company, something he already had experience with in sectors such as video gaming and food. Having started out with just four employees, Kosmos Global Holding now has a staff of 40 at its headquarters in Barcelona. \u201cI needed to create a structure,\u201d explains Piqu\u00e9.\nThe second step was to find the right person to take charge; a general director who would need to have the skills that the soccer star still lacked, such as business criteria. The man for the job was Javier Alonso Giralt, an executive with 25 years of experience, not in tennis but in motor racing, setting up races such as the Dorna championships. Piqu\u00e9 himself would be the president, but he would also be the creative force; nothing drives the soccer star harder than being able to create without restrictions, something he does instinctively with varying degrees of success. \u201cHe knows how to take a no,\u201d says Alonso.\nPiqu\u00e9 needs someone to temper his creative impulses, which have gone beyond the Davis Cup and the 25-year contract the company won to run it. He and his team are hungry for more. \u201cKosmos was started less than three years ago and it will develop initiatives in the world of sport,\u201d says Piqu\u00e9. \u201cWe know a lot about that and we can offer value in leading different, unique, original initiatives.\u201d\nThe unique angle for the Davis Cup, for example, is to avoid \u201cinbreeding;\u201d Kosmos\u2019s vision lies in making sport horizontal across the disciplines. \u201cThe idea is to feed off talent coming from a number of different disciplines in order to transform the public arena, which could be generally enriched by concrete experiences,\u201d Alonso explains.\nThe proposal to radically transform the Davis Cup bemused tennis's big wigs, which meant the team had to include prestigious figures who would take the idea door to door, federation to federation, almost player to player, explaining the project in detail; figures such as retired tennis players Galo Blanco and Albert Costa, who both have contacts on the circuit and who have helped with promotional strategies.\nOur proposal is unsettling and takes time to assimilate. But now we should try to convince those who still have their doubts\nThe pair have proved so convincing that they got almost 72% of the vote within the International Tennis Federation \u2013 66% was required \u2013 to take the project forward. But it was no easy task. Ion Tiriac, the Romanian billionaire businessman and owner of the Madrid Open tennis tournament, had issues with the idea, calling it absurd. Others like Roger Federer, politely expressed doubts. Why change a 100-year-old tradition? One of the main objections has been that the teams will no longer be able to play at least one qualifying round on home turf.\nRafael Nadal, on the other hand, has supported the idea from the beginning. \u201cHaving him on our side has been very important,\u201d says Costa. \u201cHe has managed to convince a lot of people.\u201d\nOne of the reasons the Davis Cup has become something of a relic lies in the fact that the top players often opt out. \u201cA player like Federer has only won it once,\u201d says Costa. \u201cWith this format, we hope that the top players will sign up more and more. Instead of having to keep four or five weeks free in their schedule, it\u2019s now enough to keep one; two at the most.\u201d\nRight now, the Davis Cup is Kosmos\u2019s pet project. \u201cIt is the one we\u2019ve dedicated the most time, effort and money to; an initiative that will allow everyone to know what our company is capable of,\u201d says Piqu\u00e9. In terms of investment, repackaging the world-famous tournament has cost \u20ac60 million.\nKosmos is, according to Alonso, often regarded as a start-up. Piqu\u00e9 wants to know when a company stops being a start-up and starts being a business, period. He seems impatient for the shift, as though he is keen to prove his worth in the business world with this, his most important venture to date. \u201cI understand that our project is unsettling and takes time to assimilate,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now it\u2019s November and we need to demonstrate that we were right and try to convince those who still have their doubts.\u201d\nMadrid will be their trial by fire, the test that will pave the way for other projects that are now in the pipeline \u2013 \u201cbigger ones,\u201d says Piqu\u00e9 without offering more details. Projects that are already public knowledge include the recent purchase of the third-tier soccer club FC Andorra with a view to making it grow, and an official bid to run the Barcelona Open. There are also initiatives such as a TV production described by Piqu\u00e9 as \u201ca documentary that offers insight in to Bar\u00e7a\u2019s day-to-day from the perspective of the changing rooms,\u201d which will be broadcast on Rakuten, the Amazon of Asia and Bar\u00e7a\u2019s sponsor.\nIn fact it was thanks to Piqu\u00e9 and his public relations skills that the Japanese company signed the sponsorship deal with his team. And Hiroshi Mikitani, Rakuten\u2019s founder, now figures as one of Kosmos\u2019 main investors.\nAsia offers plenty of scope for expansion, which Kosmos hopes to take advantage of \u2013 think China, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore. But it is not the only direction in which Piqu\u00e9 and his team want to expand. \u201cHe has great a great talent for public relations,\u201d Alonso says.\nPiqu\u00e9 has also forged ties with US personalities such as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and John Hoffman, the man responsible for the World Mobile Congress that takes place in Barcelona. His friendship with Zuckerberg is close. \u201cWe meet up when he comes here,\u201d says Piqu\u00e9. \u201cDespite being one of the most influential people in the world, he\u2019s easy to get close to. We also saw each other in San Francisco. I see his mind as obsessive, it doesn\u2019t stop until it gets what it wants. A visionary. He bought Instagram for an absurdly small amount; these are opportunities that come along and spotting them demonstrates your capacity for reinvention. Perhaps Facebook has reached a certain limit and young people nowadays view it as a bit old-fashioned. In that respect, he knows how to re-adapt.\u201d\nI can champion or defend the right to decide just as I have defended the Spanish side for 14 years\nPiqu\u00e9\u2019s public relations\u2019 face in business circles contrasts sharply with his role of provocateur in the media. He has clear opinions on the hierarchies of influence and also on social media. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help create a good atmosphere,\u201d he says of the latter. \u201cYou only talk to people who think the same as you, and that increasingly divides us. It has good things and bad. You have to try to take advantage of the good. Thanks to social networks, people can express their opinion without having to depend on the mainstream media, which answer to concrete interests.\u201d\nBut Piqu\u00e9 seems to thrive on agitation. He\u2019s a bad boy. Unlike his teammate Iniesta, who was greeted with wild applause on any soccer pitch, he has had to put up with being booed every time he touched the ball in Spain. He likes to rock the boat, like the time when he said he had more money than the Espanyol soccer club\u2019s budget, which is \u20ac57 million. Although he would not be drawn by TV host David Broncano when asked exactly how much money that was, Piqu\u00e9 doesn\u2019t bother to hide his pleasure in making controversial remarks.\n\u201cI enjoy myself. I have to find incentives and sometimes I look for motivation and when winning on away pitches they boo you even more. I know when I\u2019m going to cause a stir and I do it because I feel like it. I consider it to be part of the show. More so when you see that almost everything is so often a lie. In a couple of days nobody remembers what you\u2019ve said anyway. You can come out and even say something fake and it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t find it so funny, however, when asked how he feels about the prison sentences against Catalan separatist politicians for their role in the 2017 unconstitutional referendum and unilateral independence declaration. \u201cI try to be very clear,\u201d he says. \u201cI have always strongly supported the right to decide, I\u2019ve never hidden that, just as I\u2019ve never, ever said that I was pro-independence myself. People vote in secret. Why should players be obliged to take a public position? I can champion or defend the right to decide just as I have defended the Spanish side for 14 years. Politics and sport go together, hand in hand, always. The Copa Del Rey is called the King\u2019s Cup; and when you play an international game, the national anthems get sung and that\u2019s politics. Sportsmen shouldn\u2019t have an opinion? For heaven\u2019s sake. We have the same rights as anybody else to be citizens.\u201d\nThat said, Piqu\u00e9 believes the sentences were drastic. \u201cIf this is what happens to people who promote doing things without violence\u2026 It could have been sorted in many different ways. But that only happens when politicians do their jobs. They [the politicians] have been replaced by judges and they have issued the sentences. Everyone will have an opinion. Some will say the sentences were light, others too tough and others will think they were just right. But we shouldn\u2019t have had to reach this point. The politicians on both sides should have done their jobs but they didn\u2019t, though some are in jail and some aren\u2019t. Defending something through debate can\u2019t be bad. You spend two or three months locked in a room until you reach an agreement. We have talked a thousand times about politics with members of the national team, but then we have to go out on the pitch and play.\u201d\nWhat matters to Piqu\u00e9 are the reactions to his opinions among his closest circle. \u201cMy mother and father are the ones that take me most to task when I create a stir. Also my representative, Arturo Canales, particularly when I was starting out. I got into scrapes and he would have me on the phone for half an hour. Now nobody calls me anymore. They are tired of it,\u201d he says, half joking, though it is clear that the silence hurts. \u201cI felt more appreciated before, as though they cared. Now I don\u2019t even worry them. With my role as a businessman, I\u2019m more moderate.\u201d\nPiqu\u00e9 is not someone who escaped from poverty and was desperate to help out his family. He comes from the Catalan upper classes, so his resolve has nothing to do with necessity, it\u2019s just pure instinct. His father runs the family firm, which exports construction materials. His mother, Montserrat Bernabeu, is the general director of the Institut Guttman, an internationally recognized center for spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries. The bar has been set high. Ever since he was small, Piqu\u00e9 found reasons not to let them down despite being a handful. \u201cI was badly behaved in school,\u201d he says with a naughty expression.\nOne imagines that he must have felt like a leader back then at La Salle Bonanova, the school where he made life-long friendships. Nurturing them is important for his sense of security, and because he is wary of people trying to get close to him now as a high-profile figure, believing they are doing so out of self-interest. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make real friendships now,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople like me attract and seduce. But that doesn\u2019t protect me. I don\u2019t open up easily and can even seem distant.\u201d\nIn Piqu\u00e9\u2019s case, of course, the effect is intensified by his relationship with Shakira, who appeared in a Spanish court in June to answer charges of tax fraud. Piqu\u00e9 and the Colombian pop diva have been together for 10 years and she acts as one of the main driving forces behind his business ventures.\n\u201cWhen I needed to decide whether I should fight to run the Davis Cup, she said, \u2018If you see it, go for it,\u2019\u201d recalls Piqu\u00e9, who is clearly inspired by her. \u201cWhen she was 13, she left Barranquilla and focused on her dream. There are a lot of big Latin artists now, but Shakira opened things up. She has been very groundbreaking. To leave Colombia and succeed in the US is a big deal,\u201d he says.\nPiqu\u00e9 and Shakira dodge the spotlight when they can with their two children, choosing the Caribbean for vacations. \u201cWe go to Miami or to the Bahamas,\u201d says Piqu\u00e9. \u201cThe kids are doing really well. The oldest is more of a soccer player and the younger one, more of an artist. Milan is driven; he\u2019s six and he knows things I don\u2019t even know about teams and line-ups\u2026 The other day he was training with a team we\u2019ve put together with Luis [Suarez] and Leo [Messi\u2019s] sons. They scored and he said, \u2018That\u2019s like the one that Kroos scored in the Euro Cup against Sweden!\u2019 My jaw dropped. He goes on YouTube and he\u2019s like a sponge. The other one is dreamier; he plays the drums and soccer doesn\u2019t come so easily to him.\u201d\nBut whether Milan and Sasha prefer soccer or music, they\u2019ll be initiated into the world of tennis when the Davis Cup kicks off on November 18, and the battle that Piqu\u00e9 has already won in his headquarters begins on the court.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.", "date": "11/15/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
