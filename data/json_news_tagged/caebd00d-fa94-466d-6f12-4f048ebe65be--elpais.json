Mattresses, household appliances, chairs and broken tables have been tossed outside on almost every street in Orihuela, in Spain\u2019s eastern Alicante province. The upper parts of the town\u2019s historic quarter were not hit as hard by Spain\u2019s worst storm in 140 years, which last week caused torrential downpours and the Segura River to overflow. The town of 75,000 people was cut off by the flooding until Sunday night.\nThere\u2019s been a disaster and we have to clean up\nLa Campaneta local V\u00edctor G\u00f3mez\n\u201cWe were unable to leave our house for four days, because the water would drag us away. We lost the car, which was in the garage. We had food in the freezer, but there were people who needed help and the UME [Emergency Military Unit] took it away,\u201d explains Karen, who has come together with fellow teachers, Francisco de Laoces and Villar Palac\u00ed, to discuss the situation at their schools, which are completely flooded and without electricity or water in the wake of the gota fr\u00eda that hit the southeast of Spain last week. Literally meaning \u201ccold drop,\u201d gota fr\u00eda is the name given in Spain to a weather phenomenon caused by a mass of polar air arriving on the Mediterranean coast, often causing storms, heavy rainfall and flash flooding.\n\u201cPeople were asking where they could find bread,\u201d Karen continues. \u201cYou had to wait in line for two hours to get it. I told the older ones that this was what it was like after the [Spanish Civil] War and they laughed and replied, \u2018Come on, no way \u2013 this will end\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cThey brought me a loaf of bread yesterday and there is still some left for today,\u201d says 90-year-old Isabel Garr\u00e9s, who explains that a migrant \u2013 whose name escapes her \u2013 helped her save a lot of her furniture.\nEverywhere in Orihuela you can see the fallout from the disaster. The damage appears to be worse\u00a0as you arrive in the town of La Campaneta. Here the flooding was up to 1.5 meters high. Mountains of trash, furniture and TV sets are now piled up where cars used to park. But the residents have a contagious energy. \u201cWhat are we going to do? There\u2019s been a disaster and we have to clean up. Not even during the 1987 flood did we see so much rainfall \u2013 more than 50 millimeters in just a few hours,\u201d says farmer V\u00edctor G\u00f3mez. The fifth scrap dealer of the day appears in the hope of grabbing a bargain. \u201cAll the neighbors will sell something and at least get enough to pay for a meal,\u201d says V\u00edctor.\nThe road of the parish leads to Almorad\u00ed, one of the other communities hardest hit by the storm. Many locals can be seen carrying large containers for liquids \u2013 some of the houses there still don\u2019t have potable water. It\u2019s a similar situation in Dolores, another municipality in the area of southern Alicante province known as Vega Baja. A Dutchman disappeared from Dolores on Sunday, sucked into a ditch by the strong currents of the floodwaters, and remains missing. Firefighters, police and military members are wading through waist-high water in search of him. Others are searching in canoes, speedboats and even on top of tractors. Juan Manuel Ca\u00f1izares is riding one of these tractor with three family members on board to their home in the countryside.\n\u201cI helped drag two firefighting trucks out of the water with this tractor,\u201d he says, as the vehicle moves through the floodwater. A butane gas canister can be seen floating nearby. \u201cLook, those bags of alfalfa weigh 800 kilos, and they were lifted up [by the floodwater], my trucks \u2026 What a disaster. This will cost much more than \u20ac300,000,\u201d he says. As the family gets off the vehicle and approaches the house, the granddaughter bursts into tears \u2013 she sees it is flooded and all her toys are piled up in a muddy mess.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/17/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
