Nobody in the chamber applauded the statement.\nI defend exercising our right to self-determination by the end of this term\nCatalan premier Quim Torra\nTorra\u2019s partners \u2013 the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) and a significant number of lawmakers for Together for Catalonia (JxCat), the two main separatist parties in the Catalan parliament \u2013 do not see a new unauthorized poll as a viable option.\nInstead, Torra\u2019s proposal was viewed as an attempt to prolong a political term that most lawmakers see as effectively having ended already, two years ahead of time. \u201cThis is not the right time to set deadlines for ourselves,\u201d said Sergi Sabri\u00e0, the ERC spokesperson. The plan was equally rejected by the small, anti-capitalist CUP, which also supports independence from Spain.\nOther opposition parties demanded Torra\u2019s resignation over the state of affairs in Catalonia, where a general strike called for Friday capped a week of escalating violence on the streets of Barcelona and other major cities. Torra\u2019s government has shown support for the strike.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/18/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
