No suicide note was found.\nMembers of the investigation have expressed surprise at the fact that M\u00e1rquez Cabrera would kill himself shortly after flying in from the United States, telling the judge he knew \u201cmany things\u201d about PDVSA and the former ambassador, and showing a willingness to cooperate.\nBack in Venezuela the 48-year-old had been secretary general of Corporate Entities, answering to then-energy minister Rafael Ram\u00edrez, whose whereabouts are currently unknown and who is wanted by prosecutors in his country. Under the Ch\u00e1vez regime, M\u00e1rquez Cabrera oversaw tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of transactions made by South America\u2019s largest oil company.\nAround \u20ac4.5 million ended up in Europe, where the son of former ambassador Ra\u00fal Morodo (who served between 2004 and 2007) is thought to have done fictitious consulting work for PDVSA between 2008 and 2012.\nM\u00e1rquez Cabrera was an essential figure in the Morodo case under investigation at Spain\u2019s High Court. After providing testimony before Judge Santiago Pedraz, he was released but continued to face charges, and was barred from leaving Spain.\nThe former PDVSA official had flown in from the US in the knowledge that he would be detained in Madrid because of an arrest warrant against him. He was practically turning himself in, said sources familiar with the investigation.\nOn Friday afternoon, after M\u00e1rquez Cabrera had testified before the judge, Interpol authorities in Washington alerted the Spanish police about his presence on a Chicago-bound flight, and said he would be immediately deported back to Spain. This turned out to be a mistake: the Venezuelan official had booked the flight but never got on it.\nThe probe also affects Ra\u00fal Morodo, a former Spanish ambassador to Venezuela, and his son Alejo\nHis body was found on Sunday at 2.20pm inside an office building in San Sebasti\u00e1n de los Reyes-Alcobendas, 18 kilometers north of the capital, after a friend and business partner, who was repeatedly unable to contact him, called the police.\nHis death deprives investigators of key information about several ongoing cases involving former PDVSA officials who are now residing in Spain. An internal investigation by the oil company calculates that several former executives funneled away at least $500 million by awarding contracts to their own businesses and rigging bids, then laundering the proceeds in Spain.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "07/29/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
