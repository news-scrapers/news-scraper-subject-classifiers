They were among nine CDR members arrested by the Civil Guard in a raid against radical separatists suspected of planning acts of violence ahead of the second anniversary of the unauthorized independence referendum of October 1, 2017.\nOfficers seized sulfuric acid, paraffin, aluminum powder, industrial paint stripper, gasoline and thermite\nAccording to sources from the investigation, officers have video recordings that show some of the detainees testing the explosives, as well as testimony from witnesses who recognized several group members who purchased chemical substances that can be used to make explosives.\nTests conducted on the substances seized by the Civil Guard during Monday\u2019s raid have confirmed the presence of ammonium nitrate, a common fertilizer that can be used to make explosive mixtures such as ammonal, sources close to the investigation told EL PA\u00cdS. The raids also yielded sulfuric acid, paraffin, aluminum powder, industrial paint stripper, gasoline and thermite, a pyrotechnic composition with great incendiary power. Officers found documents explaining the components needed to make industrial explosives such as Goma-2.\nOn Monday, Civil Guard officers raided homes and commercial premises in the cities of Barcelona, Sabadell and Santa Perp\u00e8tua de Mogoda, in an operation dubbed \u201cOperation Judas,\u201d which was launched by an investigating judge at Spain\u2019s High Court, the Audiencia Nacional.\nThe detainees had allegedly tested the explosives in abandoned quarries\nThe investigation is yet to uncover what alleged acts of violence were being planned or where they were set to take place.\nOfficers had been investigating these nine individuals for more than a year. The detainees had allegedly been making explosive mixtures for months, and even tested the material in abandoned quarries and in one of the country houses raided on Monday. One of the detainees, Jordi R., who was arrested in Sabadell, had a fire break out inside his home three months ago, which forced his neighbors to evacuate the building. At the time, he claimed he had been cooking and forgot to turn off the stove, but investigators suspect he had been testing explosives.\nJordi R. and six other members of the group who remain in custody will be brought before High Court Judge Manuel Garc\u00eda Castell\u00f3n on Thursday for questioning. According to judicial sources, five of them have refused to give a statement to the Civil Guard. Another two, represented by public defenders, voluntarily gave statements in sessions that lasted six and eight hours, respectively.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/26/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
