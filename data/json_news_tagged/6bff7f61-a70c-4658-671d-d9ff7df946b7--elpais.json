The Civil Guard said they confiscated material that could be used to make homemade bombs, including ammonium nitrate, sulfuric acid, paraffin, aluminum powder, industrial paint stripper, gasoline and thermite. Two of the suspects have confessed that they were making and testing explosives, and detainees were found to be in possession of information about several Mossos d\u2019Esquadra police stations as well as the Civil Guard barracks in Canovelles (Barcelona).\nSources close to Carles Puigdemont say the claim about his sister\u2019s involvement is \u201cinsane\u201d\nAccording to police sources, the ERT was planning to plant explosives in parts of the AP-7 highway and to damage mobile communications towers as part of a bid to disrupt critical public infrastructure. These actions were allegedly planned for sometime between October 1, which marks the second anniversary of the unauthorized independence referendum, and the day when the Supreme Court hands down its decision on the fate of 12 political and social leaders who were tried earlier this year for leading the 2017 breakaway attempt. This widely anticipated ruling, which will determine if the defendants are guilty of rebellion against the Spanish state, is expected in the first half of October.\nOne of the suspects, Ferr\u00e1n Jolis, has been named as \u201ca key element\u201d in a plan to occupy the Catalan parliament for five days, beginning on the day of the Supreme Court ruling. According to the judge\u2019s decision ordering prison without bail, Jolis was in charge of creating a \u201csecure and undetectable\u201d channel that would enable communications between the chamber and the outside world by hacking into the Wi-Fi connections of establishments and restaurants near the Catalan parliament. According to the detention order, Jolis made the following statement in a telephone conversation: \u201cMy ass is on the line, because if I get caught they\u2019re going to throw [charges of] terrorism and organized criminal organization at me.\u201d\nAnother detainee has testified that a third, unidentified party told him that Quim Torra was aware of the plan and supported it. Another suspect has claimed that he had \u201ca personal meeting\u201d with the current Catalan premier, but did not offer any details about the same. The Civil Guard has not offered any assessment on the veracity of this claim.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/30/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
