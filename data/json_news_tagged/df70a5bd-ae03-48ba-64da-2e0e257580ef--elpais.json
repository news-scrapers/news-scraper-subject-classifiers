At least three demonstrations had been scheduled for this evening, and leading members from separatist parties such as the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) announced that they planned to participate.\nMiles de manifestantes #CDR concentrados #Diagonal #Barcelona contra la presencia #Rey #sentenciadelproceshttps://t.co/n3qUtose9n pic.twitter.com/RJxqcz3t82\nThousands of CDR protesters gathered on Diagonal in Barcelona against the presence of the king.\nThe marches were called by the Committees to Defend the Republic (CDR), a grassroots independence group that favors direct action. Demonstrators have been preventing people from accessing the building where the 2019 Princess of Girona awards ceremony is taking place.\n\u201cI am a Catalan from my head down to my toes. To be called a bad Catalan is a terrible thing to hear,\u201d said Josep Bou, a councilor for the conservative Popular Party (PP) who tried to enter the Palau de Congressos convention center. \u201cThese people did not let me attend an event. That is anything but democratic.\u201d\nThe Catalan government has sent out a message asking for \u201ca civic attitude\u201d by demonstrators. Catalonia recently experienced a week of street disturbances following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to hand down prison sentences against leaders of the failed breakaway attempt of 2017.\nDolores Delgado, the justice minister in Spain\u2019s caretaker goverment, on Monday warned that any acts that disrupt the national election on Sunday or the \u201cday of reflection\u201d on Saturday could constitute \u201ca very serious crime\u201d following Spanish electoral legislation. Delgado urged Catalan institutions to do their best to \u201cavoid any acts of violence.\u201d\nThe separatist movement has been a vocal critic of Felipe VI, particularly since his special address to the nation on October 3, 2017 in which he accused secessionist leaders of \u201cviolating the democratic principles of the rule of law\u201d with their unconstitutional referendum and unilateral independence declaration.\nGabriel Rufi\u00e1n, a leader of the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) who sits in the Spanish Congress, said that with that speech the monarch sided with the political right while the people who went out to vote in the unauthorized referendum \u201cwere still nursing their wounds.\u201d The statement alluded to the decision made by the Spanish government, then under the Popular Party (PP), to send out police to stop the referendum by force on October 1, 2017.\n\u201cWe will make it clear that Catalonia is republican, that Republic means democracy, and that neither the king nor the monarchy have any legitimacy left in the eyes of Catalan citizens,\u201d said another ERC leader, Ernest Maragall.\nOn Monday, a contingent of 1,300 police officers from the National Police and from the regional Mossos d\u2019Esquadra force were sent to protect the Palau de Congressos convention center on Diagonal avenue, on the outskirts of Barcelona. Felipe VI, his wife Letizia and their two daughters Leonor and Sof\u00eda were there to hand out the 2019 Princess of Girona Awards, an annual prize that recognizes young talent.\nThe ceremony was taking place six days before a repeat national election called by the caretaker government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez, of the Socialist Party (PSOE). Roc\u00edo Monasterio, the Madrid leader of the far-right Vox party, which stands to make significant gains at the election according to recent polls, on Monday accused S\u00e1nchez of doing nothing against \u201cthe enemies of freedom and the totalitarians\u201d who have \u201ctaken the streets\u201d of Catalonia.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/04/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
