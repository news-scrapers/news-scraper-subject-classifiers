Her face had become a distant memory to her neighbors, who had not seen her for years. However, she always paid her the building maintenance fees, the extra expenses for the new roof, her water bill and any other charge that was directly debited from her bank account, into which her pension was paid every month. In fact, the Electoral Census Office had just written to inform her which polling station to use in the upcoming November 10 general election. The problem was that Rivera had been dead for well over a decade, and nobody had realized.\nHer previous bills had been paid, so I told myself she must still be alive\nNeighbor Emilio Mu\u00f1o\nThe police found Rivera\u2019s mummified corpse inside her apartment last Tuesday after responding to a report filed by her niece, who had remembered her aunt after many years. Firefighters entered through the balcony as Rivera had left the keys inside the lock in the front door.\nRivera had died of natural causes while taking a bath; and due to the humid conditions and perfect degree of ventilation, her body had mummified in the tub. According to Spanish newspaper El Mundo, doctors declared that she had been dead for between 14 and 16 years. It is now known that she did not make it to her 80th birthday.\nBorn in 1926, Rivera had lived in the apartment in Jos\u00e9 del Hierro street since 1965. In the last 20-odd years of her life, she had lived with an architect called Juan Molina Mu\u00f1oz, a divorcee with children. At one point, Molina took over the community management of the apartment building and trouble ensued, which isolated the couple from their neighbors.\nAfter Molina\u2019s death, Rivera was left alone. The little contact she had with her family gradually petered out altogether. Neither did she exchange words with anyone in the building, except with her immediate neighbor with whom she argued about noise and smells.\nRivera had died of natural causes while taking a bath and her body mummified due to the humid conditions\nThe last time she was seen was in September 2004. If she had died any earlier, she would have been missed by the uniformed doorman Don Antonio, who was let go from his job when an intercom was installed.\nFive years ago, in January, when the Christmas lights were taken down, a cable was left between Rivera\u2019s balcony and a street light. Concerned that someone could use it climb into Rivera\u2019s home and break in, one of the neighbors, Emilio Mu\u00f1oz, 78, reported it.\n\u201cI called the police,\u201d says Mu\u00f1oz. \u201cThey came and cut the cable. I told one officer to take a look inside the apartment as it had been a long time since we had heard anything from her. Either she was dead or something had happened. We looked in the post box and saw electricity bills, but as the previous ones had been paid, I told myself she must still be alive. What more could I do?\u201d\nMu\u00f1oz wasn\u2019t the only person in the vicinity to wonder about Rivera\u2019s fate. The head of the former La Caixa bank office on her street was also curious about why her client was only paying bills and did not have any daily expenses. She turned up at Rivera\u2019s apartment to ask for her but found no answers. She didn\u2019t come back.\nThe last time Rivera was seen was in September 2004\nWorried by the bank\u2019s interest, a group of neighbors went down to the Ciudad Lineal police station to express their concern over Rivera\u2019s disappearance. Her mailbox had to be regularly emptied out because no one was collecting the letters. According to the police, the officers gave them the phone number of Rivera\u2019s sister-in-law \u2013 before any investigation could be undertaken, the authorities needed to hear from a relative. The neighbors called the number and the sister-in-law said she thought that Isabel Rivera was alive and must be in a nursing home for senior citizens.\nThere were more failed attempts to establish Rivera\u2019s whereabouts. A neighbor living on the same floor, Antonio, took advantage of a district meeting to inquire about Rivera. He said he thought she was dead. But the district authorities said they could not help due to data protection laws. Antonio dropped the issue. Meanwhile, Rivera continued to mummify in the bath, as if preparing to be discovered by some future civilization. She was still paying her bills, so nobody was missing her.\u00a0\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/29/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
