R., after his partner gave her neighbor a box for safekeeping that turned out to contain the missing man\u2019s severed head.\nThe case came to the attention of the authorities this past weekend, when the neighbor of suspect Mar\u00eda del Carmen M. G. opened the package after having kept it in her house for some time. The woman had told her neighbor that it contained sex toys, and that she wanted it out of her home ahead of a possible search by the Civil Guard in relation to the disappearance of her partner in February of this year.\nDue to the smell that was coming from the box, the neighbor decided to open it in the early hours of Saturday morning\nDue to the smell that was coming from the box, the neighbor decided to open it in the early hours of Saturday morning. Inside she found a human head in an advanced state of decomposition. The woman suffered a panic attack on making the grisly discovery and alerted the police.\nMar\u00eda del Carmen M. G. \u2013 who is 61 and from C\u00e1diz, but who has been living in Castro Urdiales in Cantabria, northern Spain for several years \u2013 was detained shortly afterwards, and is facing homicide charges. DNA tests have confirmed that the head belonged to her partner. The authorities are now searching land that belonged to the deceased, according to his cousin, Carlos Ricondo.\n\u201cWe had hopes that he would return, but after so long without any signs of life we even thought that he might have thrown himself into the sea,\u201d explained Ricondo, adding that he had always doubted the story that Mar\u00eda del Carmen had told the family after the disappearance. \u201cFirst she told us he had gone on vacation,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen we called his cellphone and got no answer, she told us that [the phone] had broken after it fell in the bath, and she gave us another phone number from which we received messages, but we didn\u2019t think it was him given the way they were written.\u201d\nAfter so long without any signs of life we even thought that he might have thrown himself into the sea\nVictim\u2019s cousin, Carlos Ricondo\nThese \u201cstrange circumstances\u201d prompted Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda\u2019s cousins to request that he call them or send them an audio message with his voice to verify that it was really him. \u201cBut we got no response, which prompted his cousin Alfonso and a [policeman] friend of his to report his disappearance.\u201d\nBut according to Ricondo, \u201cnothing could be proved\u201d and a judge shelved the case after Mar\u00eda del Carmen M. G. testified that \u201che had fled voluntarily with \u20ac12,000 that he had in the house,\u201d and that he had left her. According to Ricondo, however, the victim \u201cnever kept cash in the house.\u201d\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/03/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
