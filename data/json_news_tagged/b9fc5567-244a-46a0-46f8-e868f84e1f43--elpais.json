Despite months of negotiations, no agreement has been reached between the Socialist Party (PSOE), which won most seats at the April vote but fell short of a majority, and its most likely partner, left-wing Unidas Podemos. Acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has also been unable to strike any kind of deal with the two other biggest parties on Spain\u2019s political spectrum, the conservative Popular Party (PP) and center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens).\nFollowing established procedure, for the last two days Spain\u2019s King Felipe VI has been meeting with the leaders of parties with a congressional presence to see whether S\u00e1nchez had enough support among the deputies in Spain\u2019s lower house of parliament, Congress, to be voted back into office as prime minister.\nAfter the round of meetings concluded, Meritxell Batet, the speaker of Congress, went to meet the king to discuss his conclusions. After that encounter, the Royal Household released an official statement saying that the king would not be presenting a candidate. Felipe VI, the document read, \u201chas concluded that there is no candidate who counts on the necessary support for the Congress of Deputies to lend him its confidence.\u201d\nBarring any last-minute surprises, parliament will be dissolved next week and a repeat general election called for November 10.\nOne last-ditch attempt is, however, still possible. Formally speaking, no deadline has passed today. The last moment that an investiture vote could take place is by midnight on September 23. This means that the king could still propose a candidate should Spain\u2019s political parties inform him that someone has the support for an investiture vote, but they would have to do this deal between Wednesday and Thursday of this week in order to beat the procedural clock.\nAfter meeting with eight party leaders on Monday, the monarch sat down\u00a0on Tuesday with representatives from the Catalan nationalists of Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia), En Com\u00fa Podem (the Catalan branch of Podemos), far-right Vox, Unidas Podemos, Ciudadanos, the PP and the PSOE.\nThe picture that emerged as the day progressed was a pessimistic one, with most parties telling the king that they planned to either vote against S\u00e1nchez, or at the very least abstain, if he should decide to submit to a vote this coming weekend. For its part, the PSOE has repeatedly made clear that S\u00e1nchez would not stand at a fresh investiture vote should he not have the necessary support to win it.\nAt around 9pm on Tuesday evening, S\u00e1nchez spoke to reporters, saying that he \u201chad tried by all means available but they made it impossible for me,\u201d in reference to the other parties involved in talks. \u201cI tried to form the government that, in my judgment, Spain needs in the face of the challenges that are ahead of us. Spain does not need a government for an investiture,\u201d he added, \u201cbut rather a government for the term.\u201d\nHe continued saying that \u201ctwo conservative political forces [the PP and Ciudadanos] and a leftist political force [Unidas Podemos] have decided to block the formation of the government that Spaniards were calling for. Spaniards have said on four occasions that Spain wants to take a progressive route and we call on them to do so even more clearly on November 10.\u201d\nThe leader of the PP, Pablo Casado, said on Tuesday evening after his meeting with the king that he \u201cshared with the majority of Spaniards the sensation of not knowing how we have come to this point.\u201d He added that his party\u2019s position had been \u201ccoherent, responsible and open to dialogue,\u201d claiming that he had \u201cthe feeling that we had got to the point that S\u00e1nchez wanted since April 28.\u201d\nAsked about the chance of a last-minute deal, Casado said: \u201cI don\u2019t think now is the time to try something that hasn\u2019t been tried in the last five months.\u201d\nS\u00e1nchez has been refusing reiterated calls by Podemos for a coalition government in exchange for its support. The PSOE, which has 123 lawmakers in Congress following the April 28 election, is well short of the 175 seats needed to form a government, but for the last five months all attempts at majority-building have failed. S\u00e1nchez has been pushing for a single-party executive, and his earlier attempt to form a government failed after he submitted his plan to Congress in July and was voted down.\nJust hours ahead of his own appointment with Felipe VI on Tuesday afternoon, S\u00e1nchez telephoned the leaders of the PP, Ciudadanos and Podemos to try to secure an 11th-hour deal and avoid a repeat election.\nBut Podemos chief Pablo Iglesias, who met with the monarch on Tuesday morning, did not sound convinced. \u201cWanting to be prime minister in exchange for nothing \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the most reasonable thing,\u201d he told reporters after walking out of his meeting.\nAnd Ciudadanos chief Albert Rivera, who surprised everyone on Monday with an offer to abstain if certain conditions are met, on Tuesday withdrew the offer after describing S\u00e1nchez\u2019s response as \u201ca mockery.\u201d The conditions involve a pledge not to raise income tax, reorganizing political alliances in the northern Spanish region of Navarre, and taking a hard line on the Catalan independence crisis.\nSpeaking on Tuesday evening after meeting with King Felipe, Rivera said that \u201cS\u00e1nchez wants the other parties to give him our votes without any conditions in return. This is unheard of. If S\u00e1nchez forces elections, this country\u2019s problem will have a name: Pedro S\u00e1nchez.\u201d\nCiudadanos wants a written pledge that the government will not grant pardons to the Catalan secessionist leaders who were tried at the Supreme Court this year, if they should be found guilty in a ruling that\u2019s expected in the coming weeks.\nIn a letter signed by S\u00e1nchez and sent to Ciudadanos on Tuesday morning, the PSOE insisted that they are already meeting with these conditions, and called on Rivera to \u201cunblock the situation, honor the will of Spaniards and avoid a completely unnecessary repeat election.\u201d\nEnglish version by Susana Urra and Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/17/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
