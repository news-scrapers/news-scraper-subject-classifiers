Spain will continue to have veto rights, as stated in the political declaration that came with the earlier withdrawal agreement, and which is not being modified in this most recent draft deal.\nAnother major issue in bilateral relations \u2013 the rights of the 360,000 British nationals living in Spain and 180,000 Spaniards residing in the UK \u2013 also remains unchanged. Spain is home to the largest British community outside the UK, and if the new Brexit deal is ratified, all European residents in Britain will preserve their rights while Britons living in the EU will keep theirs. The withdrawal agreement protects access to healthcare, education and work permits, among other advantages.\nIf the new withdrawal agreement is ratified, there will be no need for Madrid to activate a contingency plan it approved in March to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.\nAlso left untouched are four memorandums of understanding (MoUs) signed in November 2018 addressing the rights of crossborder workers (more than 9,000 Spaniards cross into Gibraltar every day), the price of tobacco products in Gibraltar, environmental issues, and cooperation on police and border matters. Still pending is a tax treaty to end unfair competition from Gibraltar, which offers very advantageous conditions for registered businesses.\nIf an orderly exit is achieved, Iberia, which is part of the British group IAG, will benefit from the same current conditions at the very least during the transitional period from Britain\u2019s departure and the signing of a deal on the future relationship between Brussels and London. After that, the group will have to prove that Iberia is over 50% controlled by EU nationals in order to retain its flying rights in the bloc. Officials at IAG note that Iberia\u2019s headquarters are in Madrid and that the company pays taxes in Spain, but EU rules stipulate that a majority of capital must be EU-based as well.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/17/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
