These feelings are being reported so frequently that it\u2019s been dubbed \u201ceco-anxiety,\u201d a condition cheerily defined by the American Psychological Association as \u201ca chronic fear of environmental doom.\u201d\nAt the heart of it is exasperation at the inaction of governments around the world to adequately address an existential crisis that requires drastic and immediate action.\nAnd so over the past several weeks I\u2019ve joined hundreds of fellow climate protesters in both Madrid and Seville, as part of a coordinated global effort to demand that governments acknowledge the truth and act on the science.\nWhile it\u2019s an encouraging start, the Spanish protests have been modest in size, which is why it\u2019s imperative that more people play an active role in the struggle for change.\nBut I\u2019m not writing this from a lofty perch. I\u2019m not vegan or even vegetarian, I own a car and I usually fly a couple of times a year. Although I\u2019ve taken steps to reduce my consumption of meat and dairy and the amount of plastic I use, I\u2019m a long way from being able to wag a disapproving finger at others.\nBut I do care deeply about the environment and the natural world and that, for me, is as good a reason as any to act. In Spain, the climate emergency is not some vague, abstract concept that belongs to the future. The effects are already being felt in dramatic ways and will only worsen without decisive intervention. Increasingly ferocious wildfires and extreme flooding are already a reality for some parts of the country, while sea level rises will affect coastal areas.\nOminously for the thousands of Brits who live on the Costa del Sol and the Costa Blanca, research shows that Andalusia and Valencia will be hit hardest. Desertification, exacerbated by drought, will render vast tracts of agricultural land useless, with serious consequences for Spain\u2019s ability to grow food.\nMeanwhile, around 15 million people in Spain are breathing air that\u2019s so polluted the government is breaking the law. Because of this, an estimated 30,000 Spaniards die each year due to air pollution, according to the European Environment Agency.\nFlying is clearly a major contributor to air pollution and, as a British migrant with family in the UK, this poses an uncomfortable dilemma. But for Brits with second homes in Spain, the inconvenient truth is that they\u2019re among the worst offenders for frequent flying, House of Commons research has shown.\nAs a society we are obsessed with economic growth and the rampant consumerism that results from it. There\u2019s an assumption that every generation is entitled to more than the last, but perhaps we have to accept that that is simply not possible. We are constantly being encouraged to live beyond our means with credit cards and loans, and that mentality extends to the world\u2019s natural resources.\nEach year, researchers calculate the global demand for these resources and compare it to the Earth\u2019s capacity to regenerate them. In 1970, the date on which humanity had used up all available natural resources for that year was December 23. This year it was July 29. We are accumulating an ecological debt that will never be repaid unless we change our economic model to a more sustainable one.\nBut as long as politicians and corporations continue to place the burden of responsibility on individuals by focusing on things like recycling, nothing will change. There has to be a vast structural rethink if we are to have any hope of reducing carbon emissions to net zero. This would include a huge shift in subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables.\nBut if you think that is already on the way to being achieved then consider this eye-watering statistic: globally, we are burning 80% more coal now than we were in 2000.\nWe may not be able to effect significant change individually, but collectively we can confront governments with the truth. And as George Orwell said: \u201cIn times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\u201d\n NEWSLETTER \n Recibe la mejor informaci\u00f3n en tu bandeja de entrada \nUna breve gu\u00eda para que el hombre moderno (o sea, t\u00fa) sepa c\u00f3mo regalar joyas estas navidades evitando compras fallidas de \u00faltima hora y triste desaciertos.
