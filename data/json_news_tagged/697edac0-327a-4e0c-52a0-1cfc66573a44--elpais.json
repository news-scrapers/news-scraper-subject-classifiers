The bank\u2019s current chairman, Carlos Torres, said in a note that his priority is \u201cto clear up the facts.\u201d\nFormer police commissioner Jos\u00e9 Manuel Villarejo allegedly ran a lucrative business on the side for years, selling sensitive information to wealthy clients as leverage against their rivals and enemies.\nHe apparently had a network of \u201cmoles\u201d working for him at banks, telecommunications companies and even the Tax Agency; these employees provided him with phone records, bank accounts and tax returns containing confidential information about his own clients\u2019 targets.\nAlthough he has been in pre-trial custody since November 2017, Villarejo is thought to have ordered a trickle of recent leaks to the media, all of which have caused embarrassment to several high-profile individuals, including former Spanish King Juan Carlos I, and Justice Minister Dolores Delgado.\nIn their written request to the judge, prosecutors held that \u201cBBVA hired and made illicit payments to a company named Cenyt, whose owner was Villarejo, affecting several sensitive areas of the bank and various executives for a prolonged period of time.\u201d\nProsecutors want to probe whether BBVA hired Cenyt to spy on individuals with the goal of obtaining information about Sacyr, the construction giant that tried to push away former chairman Francisco Gonz\u00e1lez in 2004 and 2005.\nVillarejo, who has been in pre-trial custody since November 2017, worked informally for the bank for 13 years, between 2004 and 2017, during which time he earned around \u20ac10 million.\nProsecutors have reached these conclusions after analyzing paper and digital documents seized from Villarejo in November 2017, as well as material contributed by BBVA.\nThe decision to investigate the lender itself comes on top of an earlier move against eight current and former bank executives. While there are no prison terms for legal entities, an unfavorable verdict could carry hefty financial penalties.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "07/30/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
