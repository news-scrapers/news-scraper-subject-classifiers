Their school day will last until at least 2.30pm, which means it\u2019s unlikely they will be eating lunch until 3pm.\nIt\u2019s been this way for a long time. And it will continue to be this way across most of Spain for the current year at least. The problem, say the experts, is that these hours work against teenagers\u2019 biological clocks, meaning that they are in a state of permanent jet lag.\nThe continuous school day can trigger metabolic disturbances that predispose students to obesity\nPediatrician Gonzalo Pin\n\u201cWhen youngsters go to school between 8am and 2.30pm, many of them will be eating lunch at 3pm or 3.30pm, which means the time they study, have an afternoon snack, eat dinner, go to sleep is pushed back... In other words, it produces continual jet lag,\u201d says Gonzalo Pin, a pediatrician at the Quir\u00f3nsalud hospital in Valencia and member of the Spanish Sleep Society, which has long been lobbying to change the school timetable.\nStarting school later is especially important for older students who are in the last year of secondary high school (ESO) or studying for their baccalaureate (the last education stage before university), because they may be suffering from delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), a common condition that makes teens shift to later bedtimes.\n\u201cWe have an increasing amount of data highlighting the benefits of adapting the school schedule to the biological one, but we are doing exactly the opposite of what biology is telling us,\u201d says Pin. \u201cNormally, a primary student starts school at 9am, but just when they reach adolescence, they are made to start one hour earlier, which is the opposite of what should happen. Teenagers should start school even later than primary school students.\u201d\nThe imbalance between a teenager\u2019s biological clock and their school schedule has a range of repercussions. First of all, it affects academic performance since, as Pin points out, teens have \u201cminimal\u201d ability to concentrate and learn at 8am. This is backed up by the European study Sleep Habits in Student\u2019s Performance (SHASTU) led by Pin, which demonstrates the influence of sleeping habits on the emotional state of students between the ages of three and 18, and their academic results.\n\u201cOur research shows that adapting school timetables to the biological clock increases academic performance by at least one [percentage] point, particularly in children who were previously performing poorly,\u201d says Pin. \u201cIt also reduces the number of behavioral problems in the classroom, making learning time more efficient.\u201d\nA study by Boston Children\u2019s Hospital found that over 78% of pre-adolescents were excessively tired during the first hour of school\nBut these are not the only benefits of starting school later. An increasing number of studies show that excessively early school timetables lead to a chronic lack of sleep in students. This lack of sleep, according to Pin, directly affects the connection between the front part of the brain, which controls executive functions, and the limbic system, which controls emotions, \u201cincreasing the difficulty of mental order and cases of depression and anxiety.\u201d\nAs far as Pin is concerned, adapting school hours with the students\u2019 internal clocks would \u201cimprove students\u2019 quality of life.\u201d This has been demonstrated by multiple studies carried out in countries such as the United States, Germany and Israel. According to the results of these studies, adolescents spend 88% of the time gained by later school hours sleeping. This is confirmed by studies carried out by scientists from the neurology department of the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and published in the magazine Sleep Health. Their research has found that 78.4% of pre-adolescents and 57.2% of adolescents who participated in the study were excessively tired during the first hour of school. Starting just 50 minutes later reduced tiredness in 4.8% and 8.5% of these groups respectively, as the students were able to sleep an average of 30 minutes more on school nights.\nIn the northeastern Spanish region of Catalonia, 25 high schools have started the school year with a new schedule, in which students eat at school between 1pm and 2pm instead of waiting until they go home.\nThis is just one of many recommendations included in the Pact for Schedule Reform in Catalonia, which were outlined in the Bofill Foundation\u2019s report, Education on Time. The reports says consideration must be given to the body\u2019s natural rhythms, concentration cycles and fatigue with regard to the student\u2019s age, arguing \u201ca healthier timetable from a physical, mental and emotional point of view has been shown to contribute to any child or teenager\u2019s motivation and willingness to learn.\u201d\nWe are doing exactly the opposite of what biology is telling us\nPediatrician Gonzalo Pin\nPin believes the Catalan school schedule should be applied to all ESO and baccalaureate students in Spain. Firstly, because school cafeterias provide a level-playing field when it comes to lunch and give students the chance to learn about nutrition. And secondly, because adapting eating and sleeping schedules to the body\u2019s natural rhythm decreases chronodisruption (the disruption of normal circadian rhythms), a problem that can contribute to obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\u201cWith the continuous school day, teenagers eat very late at a time when resistance to insulin and fat imbalance rises,\u201d says Pin. \u201cIf we take into account that they are also suffering from a chronic lack of sleep, this can trigger metabolic disturbances that predispose them to obesity.\u201d\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/19/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
