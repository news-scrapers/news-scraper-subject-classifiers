A legend was born at that precise moment, as he reportedly proceeded to execute a series of mind-blowing moves with his present. \u201cWe froze when we saw all the things he knew how to do, because he had never played soccer before,\u201d says his father, Jorge, in Luca Caioli\u2019s biography, Messi.\nMessi\u2019s instinctive handling of the ball led to fame at an early age. During the half-time breaks at matches played by the Newell\u2019s Old Boys club, his name would be called out and Messi, standing barely one meter tall, would descend the stairs of Coloso del Parque stadium without once dropping the ball from his feet. It is this artistic spirit that Cirque du Soleil has captured in its groundbreaking show Messi10, which is due to open in Barcelona on October 10.\n\u201cLeo is the best in the world and we want to represent his skills on the pitch \u2013 his strength and determination,\u201d says Mukhtar Omar Sharif, the show\u2019s director. \u201cBut we are still a circus and this a show for everyone, not just for soccer lovers.\u201d\nThe idea for the production originally came from Jos\u00e9 Manuel Pinto, a former Barcelona goalkeeper and founder of Wahin Makinaciones Records, who also happens to be an artist with Sony and a great friend of Messi\u2019s. \u201cI always believed there were a lot of parallels between music and sport and that they fed into each other,\u201d says Pinto, who is now a sound engineer.\nPinto took the idea to Afo Verde, president of Sony Latin America, Spain and Portugal, who had already collaborated with Cirque du Soleil on earlier projects. \u201cWhat if we do a show and combine it with soccer?\u201d ventured Pinto.\nThe Sony CEO was excited: \u201cYes, we could tell the story of someone like Michael Jackson or The Beatles,\u201d he replied. At which point, Pinto interjected with, \u201cWell, I have a friend who is the greatest of them all and he\u2019s still alive. It would be great to do it with someone who is still living.\u201d And the CEO agreed: \u201cIt would be fabulous!\u201d\nDays later, Verde was at the Camp Nou stadium along with the Cirque du Soleil directors to watch Messi in action and get some ideas together for the extravaganza.\nBut while the proposal started to take shape, it still needed Messi\u2019s approval. \u201cI went to see him and explained the idea,\u201d says Pinto. \u201cI knew he would like it because we had gone to see it [Cirque du Soleil] with our families.\u201d\nAs Pinto had anticipated, Leo was all for it, though he was anxious to know how the two different skill sets could be woven together.\n\u201cMessi has followed the show and its developments closely,\u201d says the show\u2019s creative director Sean McKeown at Cirque du Soleil\u2019s Montreal headquarters, where the artists are rehearsing against the clock from dawn to dusk. \u201cWe have had around five check-points with him during which he only asked for a couple of things: that his family should be represented since he feels that he would not have got into the elite without them, and that we present acts that have never been seen before in the circus.\u201d\nChallenge accepted. \u201cHe has broken and continues to break all records, so it is up to us to come up with an unforgettable show,\u201d says McKeown. \u201cAnd we will do it because these guys [referring to the artists] are crazy. It\u2019s incredible what they manage to do simply by setting their minds to it.\u201d\nSome credit also has to go to Cirque du Soleil\u2019s recruitment team. The company has 46 artists from all over the world performing Messi10, including countries such as Taiwan, Ethiopia, China, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, Russia, Kazakhstan, Spain and the United States. All of them are first-class athletes, each with their own specialty such as the corde lisse, the trapeze, the spinning diabolo, contortionism and the banquine act, which involves acrobats jumping on and off human towers.\nCirque du Soleil has 60 people in their casting department as well as 20 talent scouts posted around the world. \u201cI saw there was an audition, I went for it and it went well,\u201d says Catalina Vega, one of the world\u2019s top soccer freestylers, whose eye-watering agility with the ball has earned her a starring role in the show. \u201cThis is an opportunity you can\u2019t miss because the gig could last for around 10 years,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it does involve a lot of hours of work because we are not just freestylers, we do everything.\u201d\nFrenchman Gautier Fayolle, a seven-time world freestyler champion who will perform with Catalina, agrees. \u201cThis is a great experience because I have a trainer for the first time who guides me,\u201d he says, catching his breath after performing a number of stunts. \u201cIt also means I can try out a lot of new things that I couldn\u2019t try at home.\u201d\nIt is impossible not to look heavenwards when you enter the vast Cirque du Soleil \u2018Big Top\u2019 in Montreal, where the sets have been created for this show. Everything appears to take place at vertiginous heights, such as the acrobatics performed by a young artist named Jimmy who is a former trampoline champion. \u201cI had two dreams \u2013 to go to the Olympics and to get into Cirque du Soleil, an ambition I had after seeing the Alegria show many years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cFortunately, one of the two has come true.\u201d\nAfter hours of rehearsals, all the artists gather in the dining room. \u201cHow do we look?\u201d asks No\u00e9 Chemel, a Belgian trampoline champion and Europe\u2019s number three in 2014. His mother thought jumping would take the edge off his hyperactivity.\nAnother artist keen to know how the show is shaping up is the Ethiopian contortionist Malik, who can bend his body in ways that defy reason.\nAll the artists are eager for feedback from people other than their trainers. \u201cWe are so used to this routine that the things we do seem almost normal,\u201d says Nacho Ricci, an Argentine who specializes in the corde lisse \u2013 a vertical rope \u2013 and who is looking forward to the premiere in Barcelona so that his friends can come and see him in action. Ricci landed the gig after years of talks and emails that concluded in an offer dependent on a video audition. \u201cThey asked me to show specific skills and also to perform some hip hop, something I had never done before. But I guess I got what I wanted,\u201d he says.\nOnce the artists have been taken on board, Cirque de Soleil puts the machinery in gear. \u201cWe do everything in depth,\u201d says McKeown,\u201d because it\u2019s the detail that makes the difference.\u201d\nFirst, after arriving at the talent factory in Montreal, the successful candidates undergo all kinds of physical and psychological examinations to check whether they need any minor surgery and to see how they perform under stress. They also take measurements for the costumes they will wear \u2013 Cirque du Soleil has its own sewing studio with 300 permanent employees.\n\u201cWe run up 16,000 costumes and make 1,200 pairs of shoes a year,\u201d says James Lavoie. \u201cBut for this show we will only use 165 different pieces. I think we are creating our own version of a soccer universe through our clothes.\u201d\nLavoie shows off a costume made from natural grass as well as a pair of trousers that give the impression of being pixelated as though the wearer was on TV. \u201cMessi tells us which ones he prefers, but we know that he has approved them all,\u201d Lavoie adds.\nThe size of the sewing operation is matched by the rest of the Cirque du Soleil headquarters, which cover 36,000 square meters. There is a make-up room that offers 60 hours of courses while other spaces are used to prepare the acrobats, many of whom have never had any training in theater or choreographies, nor worked on facial expression.\nIn order to enter this Messi world, it is necessary to go through the door to Les Studios Gilles Ste-Croix \u2013 named after one of the Cirque Du Soleil\u2019s founders. This is a 20-meter-high pavilion that is still not big enough for the main act; in Barcelona, the premiere will take place in the immense Parc del F\u00f2rum, which is more than 40 meters long and 27 meters wide. The aim is to replicate a soccer pitch with the spectators sitting around it. Preparations started on August 16 when ships carrying the necessary structures and materials left Canada for Barcelona. And as Messi stipulated, the end result will be unique.\n\u201cWe are not a traditional circus; rather, we create acts that have never been done before,\u201d says Igor, one of the show\u2019s main trainers. He made his career at the Moscow Circus and comes from a family of circus performers. \u201cThe key is to combine soccer with our artistry, and I believe we have succeeded because, as far as I\u2019m concerned, this is the best show I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 partly because of the level we have aimed for and partly because of the response of the protagonists.\u201d\nIt is also thanks to the director, Mukhtar, who is crazy about soccer and Manchester United. \u201cWhen they asked me to direct the show, my wife said, \u2018This is just so you can watch more soccer, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 And I replied, \u2018Hell, no! This is my show!\u2019 Although inside I was thinking, \u2018The hardest thing will be to create a spectacle that lives up to the world\u2019s best player\u2019.\u201d\nBut this thought doesn\u2019t hamper any of the acrobats involved in Messi10. \u201cLooking around, everyone excels at what they do,\u201d adds Mukhtar. \u201cWe are playing in the big leagues. The circus, like soccer, is hard work. You get it wrong and you start again. You practice until it\u2019s perfect. You don\u2019t get to be number one without putting in the effort.\u201d\nBut sometimes things do go wrong, and there is always the risk of injury. \u201cThis is a risky business,\u201d says Igor, who is working with the freestylers. But Jimmy, who has just performed a series of jumps from a swing, adds: \u201cIt\u2019s something we don\u2019t think about. If we did, we wouldn\u2019t even try to do it.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Yang Huang, who started balancing acts at the age of seven because her mother didn\u2019t want her simply playing with a ball, explains how she prepares herself mentally. \u201cI put on music to stay alert and keep my mind clear. Otherwise, you make mistakes.\u201d\nIn the event of injury, Cirque de Soleil has a team of physiotherapists on hand. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for people putting themselves at risk every day and pushing their bodies to the limit not to injure themselves,\u201d says Mariana, a Brazilian physiotherapist who left the Cirque du Soleil to attend to injuries at the Brazil Olympics in 2016, but who is now back for the Messi10 show. \u201cThere are all kinds of injuries but we work a lot in prevention so that when they do happen, they are not so pronounced and don\u2019t take so long to heal.\u201d\nWith prevention in mind, Cirque Du Soleil has decided to innovate and is working with RealTrack Systems, a physical activity monitoring system devised by a Spanish-based company using Wimu, a wifi data collection device used by Bar\u00e7a players, including Messi, to measure acceleration, speed and distance as well as heart rate and physical ability. \u201cIt\u2019s new and we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to work,\u201d says Mariana. \u201cBut it seems as though we can get data that helps to improve the artists\u2019 performance. We will see what the results are, then decide if we will work with them going forward.\u201d\n\u201cWe always have a plan B in case someone gets injured or sick on the day of the show,\u201d says McKeown. \u201cWe try to have at least one understudy for each artist because you never know what kind of injury they could get and how long they will be out of action. But if there\u2019s one thing we know is that in this world, the show must go on.\u201d\nAnd this is about Messi: \u201cThe story of a youngster with an ambition that made him overcome all obstacles to become the best Number 10 in history,\u201d according to the promotional material for the show.\n\u201cBut we want to explain that the 10 could be anyone \u2013 a doctor, a lawyer,\u201d Mukhtar adds. \u201cIt\u2019s about someone having a dream and making it come true through work and commitment.\u201d\nThere is, however, only one Messi \u2013 just as there is only one Cirque du Soleil. And together they have created something extraordinary.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.", "date": "09/13/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
