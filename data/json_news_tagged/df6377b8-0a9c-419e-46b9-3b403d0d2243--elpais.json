She last saw her father, Rafael, in 1936, when she was three years old. \u201cThey took him away, they killed him and then they hid him.\u201d Much later, she discovered to her horror that his body had been taken to the Valley of the Fallen, a controversial monument, northwest of Madrid, where former Spanish dictator Francisco Franco was buried in 1975.\n\u201cFranco is the reason why my mother cried for years, why I never had a childhood, and why my daughters will never know their grandfather, or my grandchildren their great-grandfather,\u201d she says.\nThey need a dignified burial\nJustice Minister Dolores Delgado\nThe Spanish Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday in favor of Franco\u2019s exhumation from the Valley of the Fallen, rejecting an appeal from the dictator\u2019s family to stop the caretaker Socialist Party government\u2019s plan. Franco\u2019s remains may now be moved to another cemetery before campaigning for the November 10 general election begins. But this will not be enough for Abril. She wants to recover her father\u2019s body from the site, which holds the unmarked remains of more than 33,000 victims of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), including Republican fighters whose bodies were taken from mass graves and buried at the monument without their families\u2019 consent.\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s a relief that they have allowed the transfer [of Franco\u2019s remains]. It was painful and ridiculous that my father was next to his executioner, as though [Franco] was still watched over him. But there is an unresolved issue that continues to cause pain: I want to have a dignified site to bury my father and to be able to bring him flowers, like any other person. And we are running out of time,\u201d she explains.\nAround 20 relatives of Republicans buried in the Valley of the Fallen have requested to have the remains of their family members returned to them. Manuel Lape\u00f1a, 95, brought the issue to the courts, and after a lengthy process, won a court order in 2016 to exhume his father and uncle. The government has promised to \u201cdo everything possible\u201d to return the remains, but the families are beginning to lose patience with the slow-moving process.\n\u201c[On Monday] I received a letter from Prime Minister S\u00e1nchez,\u201d says Abril, referring to the leader of the Socialist Party (PSOE), who spearheaded the push to exhume Franco\u2019s remains from the Valley of the Fallen. \u201cHe was responding to mine in which I asked him to speed up the exhumations. He replied that they are going to try to solve the situation. But time passes. Many have already passed away without seeing it happen. Only a few children and grandchildren who have not abandoned their grandparents remain.\u201d\nThe victims of the Valley of the Fallen still need reparation\nLawyer Eduardo Ranzo\nOn February 26, the Justice Ministry organized for Abril and five other Republican relatives to visit the crypt where their loved ones are buried. \u201cThrough a tiny window I saw lots of stacked boxes, each one from a town,\u201d says Abril.\nOn March 12, then-Justice Minister Dolores Delgado, of the PSOE, delivered a document to 11 families aimed at providing \u201cmoral reparation\u201d for their loss. \u201cThey were thrown in, not buried,\u201d she stated in the recognition certificate. \u201cThe Valley of the Fallen is the largest mass grave in Spain, where the remains of 33,800 people, 18,000 of them Republican live. They need a dignified burial.\u201d\nThe government has taken DNA samples from the family members to try to identify the remains once they are exhumed. But not all descendants have the same luck. Water has leaked into some of the crypts and destroyed the wooden boxes containing the bones.\nEduardo Ranzo, who represents six of the families of the Republicans, sums up the situation: \u201cExhuming the dictator is fundamental for this country because it puts an end to a democratic anomaly. But the victims of the Valley of the Fallen still need reparation.\u201d\nThe 13.6-square kilometer Valley of the Fallen site remains hotly contested in a country still struggling to come to terms with the legacy of the fascist dictatorship of Franco, who was the Spanish head of state from the end of the Civil War in 1939 to his death in 1975.\nThe site was ostensibly built to commemorate all of the victims on both sides of Spain\u2019s bitter and bloody Civil War (1936-1939), and the unmarked remains of more than 33,000 victims of the conflict lie there. But critics point out that the Valley of the Fallen, which features a basilica and a 150-meter-high cross that dominates the surrounding countryside, contains just two marked graves: those of Franco himself and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of the Falange, Spain\u2019s fascist-inspired political party. At the same time, thousands of prisoners of war who fought against Franco in the civil conflict were among the workforce used in its construction.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/25/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
