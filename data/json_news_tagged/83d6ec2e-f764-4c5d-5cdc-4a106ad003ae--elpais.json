These are some of the issues that they will have to take into account:\nThe site is run by the Foundation of the Holy Cross of the Valley of the Fallen, which was created in 1957 under Franco. A community of Benedictine monks is in charge of it, and receives an annual state subsidy of \u20ac340,000 to carry out its duties. The government is now considering placing the foundation under direct orders from the executive, or else reaching a new agreement with the Catholic Church to replace the Benedictine community with another Church institution.\n\u201cThe Benedictines have earned an expulsion from the Valley. Their hostility to the transformation of the monument is incompatible with their presence there,\u201d says J\u00e1uregui. \u201cThey had a mission, which has to protect Franco\u2019s grave, and that mission has ended.\u201d\nThe government also wants to move the grave of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, founder of Spain\u2019s fascist-inspired Falange party, from its current spot near the altar of the basilica to one of the sides. In 2011, the expert report agreed that Primo de Rivera could be considered a victim too, as he was executed by the Republican government in November 1936, during the first months of the war. Not everyone agrees with this view.\nIn 1940, a year after his victory, Franco had no intention of including the enemy\u2019s dead in his project for the Valley of the Fallen, which he thought would be completed in six years. Instead it took 18. In many cases, the Franco regime opened up mass graves and took the bodies of thousands of republicans to the Valley without their relatives\u2019 knowledge or consent. The government now wants to return those remains to their relatives and repair the Valley\u2019s columbaria, which have been damaged by damp.\nThere is still no decision on how the Valley of the Fallen will become a \u201cplace of memory,\u201d and everything is on hold until after the election. J\u00e1uregui would like to hold \u201can international competition for ideas\u201d to turn the esplanade in front of the basilica into an interpretation center. Francisco Ferr\u00e1ndiz, an anthropologist at the state-run scientific council CSIC, is asking for \u201ca brave an ambitious project,\u201d and notes that it took \u201c15 years of social and political debate\u201d to complete the monument to the victims of the Holocaust in Berlin.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/25/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
