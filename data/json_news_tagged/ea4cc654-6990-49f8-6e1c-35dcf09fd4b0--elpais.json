The business, located in Porto Palermo in the south of the Balkan country, had been operating without a license for years. The actions of its owner, a man named Mihal Kok\u00ebdhima, made headlines both in his home country and back in Spain, after he assaulted well-known Spanish businessman Eugenio Gald\u00f3n and members of his family, as well as an Albanian tour guide and driver.\nThe assault on the Spanish family prompted the decision to demolish the building\nThe incident took place on August 15, and was reportedly prompted by the group of Spaniards canceling two of the seven dishes that they had ordered in the restaurant. Kok\u00ebdhima came running out of the premises and apparently jumped onto the hood of the family\u2019s rental car. As cellphone footage shows, there he stayed for around 10 minutes with the vehicle in motion, punching the windshield until he broke a hole into it, to the shock of the occupants of the car. Also in the video is the moment that he tried to open the driver\u2019s side door, which is when the vehicle managed to make its escape.\nThe assault on the Spanish family prompted the decision to demolish the building, and was taken by the body in charge of protecting touristic heritage in the country. Kok\u00ebdhima\u2019s family did not put up any resistance to the move.\nThe restaurant itself had been closed for several days, after the authorities became aware of the incident, which left Gald\u00f3n \u2013 the founder of telecoms company ONO \u2013 and one of his children with minor injuries, and ended up requiring the intervention of the Spanish Embassy in the Albanian capital, Tirana.\nAfter the assault, Kok\u00ebdhima \u2013 who is aged 51 and is known as \u201cthe gladiator\u201d by his neighbors \u2013 was arrested and placed in preventive custody, and faces charges of intimidation, deliberate damage and destruction of property.\nKok\u00ebdhima\u2019s lawyer argued that he got onto the hood of the vehicle to defend himself and claimed that the tourists had smoked cannabis\nAccording to the Alabanian daily Shqiptarja.com, the local council of Himara, where the restaurant was located, already tried to bulldoze the premises in 2012.\nA smiling Kok\u00ebdhima appeared on Tuesday before judges, and his lawyer argued that he got onto the hood of the vehicle to defend himself and claimed that the tourists had smoked cannabis and that their two companions were drunk.\nIn the wake of the incident, a number of local and foreign tourists have been stopping outside the restaurant to take pictures.\nThe restaurant was the only one in the Porto Palermo bay, which is an enclave in the so-called \u201cAlbanian Riviera.\u201d It had 2,000 square meters of space and, as well as operating without a license, also made use of part of the neighboring beach. The owner had set out sun loungers, which he charged for \u2013 also without the proper permissions. During the times of the country\u2019s communist dictatorship, the area was home to installations for submarine repairs.\nThe assailant is the cousin of the former Socialist deputy Koco Kok\u00ebdhima, who is involved in construction as well as owning the daily Shekulli and the Abissnet internet firm. He was a one-time friend and colleague of the Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, but was expelled from the Socialist Party and now runs a small political group.\n\n The video shared by the Albanian prime minister of the Gald\u00f3n family meeting with the country\u2019s tourism minister.\nRama himself published an apology via his Facebook page for the behavior of Kok\u00ebdhima. \u201cThe barbarian who struck our Spanish friends has violated the sacred code of Albanian hospitality and has brought shame upon us all,\u201d he wrote, sharing a video that showed the country\u2019s tourism minister, Blendi Klosi, receiving the family to apologize for what happened.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/22/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
