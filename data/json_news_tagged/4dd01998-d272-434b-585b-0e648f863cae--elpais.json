For the last five years this area had been part of the Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed caliphate, which the child\u2019s parents, the Spanish citizens Luna Fern\u00e1ndez and Mohammed el Amin, had joined. But these days, it is Kurdish militias who are in charge of an area dotted with camps, and where more than 80,000 jihadist women and their children are waiting to be returned to their countries of origin.\nLuna Fern\u00e1ndez, 30, was in labor \u201cfor nine hours\u201d and received no medical attention beyond help from an Indonesian jihadist who is a doctor and from \u201cother women at the camp,\u201d according to information obtained by Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s relatives in Spain. \u201cThe little girl is big and fortunately both mother and child are doing well,\u201d reads one of the messages sent from Syria, and to which EL PA\u00cdS has had access.\nThe birth of little Asiyah brings to 16 the total number of Spanish minors trapped in the Syrian camps for families from the Islamic State (ISIS). The Spanish women who joined ISIS have been held for half a year now inside these camps, which have morphed into something of a miniature female caliphate dotted with abayat, the full-body black garments worn by the women there.\nWhen the caliphate fell, the Spanish women were first taken to Al Hol camp, the largest of the six in this area. The first to arrive was Fern\u00e1ndez, who was pregnant and in charge of eight children \u2013 four of her own and four more fathered by her husband with his second wife. The children\u2019s father died in Syria.\nThe second Spanish woman to arrive in Al Hol was Yolanda Mart\u00ednez, 34, who has four children. Her husband, the jihadist fighter Omar al Harshi, is the only Spanish citizen known to be held inside a Kurdish prison in Syria. And then came Lubna Fares, 40, who holds Moroccan citizenship but whose three children are Spanish because her jihadist husband, who also died in the caliphate, was a naturalized Spaniard.\nAll three of them were attached to the most radical core of foreign fighters who resisted to the end until the fall of the caliphate\u2019s last stronghold, the dusty oasis of Baghouz on the border with Iraq. The last jihadist holdout fell in March after being targeted by Kurdish-Arab militias on land and by airstrikes commanded by a US-led international coalition of which Spain is a part.\nSince the beginning of this year, more than 300 children have died inside these Syrian camps due to respiratory problems, malnutrition and other diseases. There are 40,000 minors inside Al Hol, of whom 3,500 are foreign nationals \u2013 nearly half are European \u2013 while around 500 are unaccompanied minors, according to the non-profit group International Rescue Committee. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources to deal with their needs,\u201d insist Kurdish officials, who are urging countries of origin to take back their jihadist nationals or, failing that, to support the creation of an international tribunal in northeastern Syria. A few days ago, a delegation from the German government returned from Syria with four children, raising to 40 the number of European orphans who have been repatriated since March. Seventeen of these children are from France, seven from Sweden, five from Norway and two from the Netherlands, according to a tally by the Kurdish militias.\nFighting among women is a regular occurrence at the camps, where three Kurdish police officers were stabbed to death by jihadist women while a fourth was injured. \u201cThey kicked out my eldest son [Bilal, 14] from the tent because they say he is an adult,\u201d Mart\u00ednez claims.\nCases of cholera have proliferated due to the dirty water, as have the number of children with high fevers caused by snake bites. Children have their heads shaved to prevent the spread of lice. A non-profit worker with access to the Al Roj and Al Hol camps said in a telephone conversation that \u201cmedical and sanitary conditions are deplorable.\u201d There is no drinking water for days at a time and \u201ca shortage of toilets and showers,\u201d adding to the psychological pressure on kids who are already traumatized by war and \u201cconstantly exposed to the radical rhetoric of many of the women there.\u201d Mart\u00ednez says that two of her children suffer from malnutrition, and that her daughter Aisha, who is six years old, only weighs 10 kilograms. \u201cHer hair has fallen out, and her body is covered with hives,\u201d her mother says.\n\u201cThere will be no decisions regarding the repatriation of Spanish nationals from ISIS in Syria until Spain appoints a government,\u201d says a government official in Madrid. According to this source, Spain\u2019s High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, is \u201cputting together the legal case\u201d so that returning jihadist women will \u201cserve sentences,\u201d although the male Spaniard in a Kurdish-controlled prison was not mentioned. The most likely criminal charge they could face is being members of a terrorist group; this is the crime for which several members of the jihadist cell known as the Al-Andalus Brigade are serving eight-year sentences in Spain. The three Spanish adults currently in custody in Syria, as well as the two dead husbands, were part of this brigade.\nIn the absence of a European agreement to create a tribunal to try their nationals, countries fear the return of radicalized individuals whom they may not be able to try for lack of evidence. In the meantime, EU member states have begun repatriating their most vulnerable nationals: orphaned children.\nIn May, the three Spanish jihadist women said they were called by Kurdish agents who offered them the chance to sign a request for repatriation to Spain. Instead, Mart\u00ednez and Fern\u00e1ndez were transferred along with their children to Al Roj, where living conditions are better. Fares chose to remain in Al Hol with her kids. Three months after that apparent attempt by Spanish authorities at contacting them, both Spanish women at Al Roj claim that Kurdish agents have given them documents sent \u201cfrom Spain\u201d informing them that they may voluntarily request repatriation while knowing that they could face \u201cprison terms of two to five years\u201d back home. These letters, according to sources who are close to the women\u2019s families, state that repatriation could take place \u201cwithin one or two months.\u201d\nBut relatives of both these women say they have received no response from the Spanish government following their request, filed on May 12, to have them and their children brought back to Spain.\nAs for authorities in the Self-Administration of North & East Syria (SA-NES), a body led by an alliance of Kurdish-Arab forces, they deny having received any kind of request from Madrid. \u201cThe Spanish government has made no official contact with us at any time,\u201d says Abdulkarim Omar, who is in charge of external relations at SA-NES.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/27/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
