The Constitutional Court has refused to admit the appeal filed by one of the officers, which means the case will be permanently shelved.\nAccording to the court writ, to which EL PA\u00cdS has had access, the justices did not consider the appeal to have the \u201cspecial constitutional transcendence\u201d required to be heard in the Constitutional Court.\nIn 2018, Mart\u00ednez-Bordi\u00fa was originally sentenced to 30 months in prison for attacking law-enforcement officers and for reckless driving by a lower criminal court in Teruel, in Spain\u2019s eastern region of Arag\u00f3n.\nMart\u00ednez-Bordi\u00fa was accused of reckless driving and attacking law enforcement officers\nThe conviction concerned an incident that took place on the night of April 30, 2012, when the Civil Guard tried to stop a car that was driving with its lights off, down the wrong side of the road on the N-234 highway. The driver ignored the signals and fled the scene.\nThe Civil Guard officers pursued the vehicle for 30 kilometers and caught up with it at a spot between Collados and Laguerruela. Once the car had stopped, a passenger pointed a shotgun at the officers, while the driver reversed and plowed into their patrol car before racing away. One of the officers was injured in the crash. The vehicle, which was found five hours later, was registered under the name of a company owned by Francisco Franco Suelves, the son of Mart\u00ednez-Bordi\u00fa.\nIn February 2018, a criminal court in Teruel ruled that Mart\u00ednez-Bordi\u00fa was the driver of the vehicle, basing the decision on a statement provided by one of the officers, who said he recognized Franco\u2019s grandson as the person driving the car. Mart\u00ednez-Bordi\u00fa appealed the decision and was acquitted by the provincial court of Teruel, on the basis that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to undermine the presumption of innocence.\nBorn in 1954, Francisco Franco Mart\u00ednez-Bordi\u00fa, known as Francis, changed the order of his surnames in order to publicly maintain the Franco bloodline. He was wed to the Peruvian aristocrat Mar\u00eda Suelves before getting divorced and marrying Miriam Guisasola. The couple have had a rocky relationship, however, having broken up and got back together on numerous occasions. They are currently separated. Francis heads the family businesses and is in charge of dividing the inheritance left behind by his mother. Among their most valuable assets is the family home where Carmen Polo lived and died, a building located on Hermanos B\u00e9cquer street in Madrid and valued at \u20ac50 million. He has also defended the legacy of his grandfather in a book he wrote entitled The nature of Franco.
