The hotel has more than 400 rooms, but the occupants of just 15 tables are listening as he performs classic hits from yesteryear. The song Marmor, Stein und Eisen \u2013 a 1960s hit by the German singer Drafi Deutscher \u2013 is more enthusiastically received than Neil Diamond\u2019s Sweet Caroline. It confirms a comment made by one of the waiters: \u201cSeventy percent of customers came from [British travel group] Thomas Cook. There are practically no English [customers] left, and no more are coming.\u201d Now the German visitors have taken over, and they like Drafi Deutscher.\nThe big drama is the issue of connecting flights. We do not have the AVE or highways here\nNicol\u00e1s Villalobos, managing director of beCordial Hotels & Resorts\nThe impact of the collapse of the British tour giant Thomas Cook, which ceased activity last Monday, can be seen in other ways. Now there\u2019s no need for hotel guests to reserve the poolside lounges with their beach towels before going for breakfast. From morning to night, couples and groups gather in front of the tour-provider areas to find out how they will be transferred to the airport so they can return to their countries. The information is put up on notices, and no employees are to be seen.\nOn Monday, buses are scheduled to take a hundred British hotel guests to the airport, where they will be flown back to Birmingham, Gatwick, Manchester and Bristol on repatriation flights that the British government was forced to organize after the collapse of Thomas Cook.\nThe fall of the British travel giant has affected the 600,000 people who had bought or booked vacations with the company, including the 150,000 British tourists who were left stranded because of the collapse. It has also led to 21,000 job losses, and has painted a very dismal picture for the countries that have been the most popular destinations of Thomas Cook customers. Spain\u2019s Canary Islands, where high season lasts from October until Easter, have been hardest hit by the fall. \u201cIt leaves us with very little capacity to respond,\u201d says Francisco Moreno, the head of communication of the hotel chain Lopesan, which manages 17 establishments in the Canary Islands.\nThe British travel group paid hotels and transportation companies in the region within 90 days, which could jeopardize many companies\u2019 summer income, especially those that are more reliant on Thomas Cook\u2019s business. What\u2019s more, all reservations made with the tour operator for the upcoming weeks are gone. One in four foreign tourists (around 3.4 million a year) were brought to the Canary Islands by the British tour operator, according to hotel association ASHOTEL and the hotel federation FEHT, which indicates the scale of the problem.\nMoreno is confident that other tour operators will be quick to fill the gap left by Thomas Cook, but he says the main problem is the collapse of Thomas Cook\u2019s airlines: \u201cOn their [Thomas Cook] planes, there were also passengers who had packages with other tour operators, which can no longer send their customers to us,\u201d he explains.\nI think the market is going to have the capacity to immediately fill a large part of what has been lost\nUGT labor union spokesperson Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Ram\u00edrez\nIt\u2019s a concern shared by Nicol\u00e1s Villalobos, the managing director of the hotel chain beCordial Hotels & Resorts, which received between 20% and 25% of its guests from Thomas Cook. \u201cThe big drama, beyond the commercial fall [of Thomas Cook], is the issue of connecting flights. We do not have the [high-speed rail network] AVE or highways here. There\u2019s no alternative. The flights are our highways to the European continent,\u201d he says.\nThe tourism sector in the Canary Islands is wary of the ripple effect the collapse of Thomas Cook could have on the industry. The British group\u2019s best-known German subsidiary, Neckermann, has collapsed as well. But Thomas Cook\u2019s Condor airline is continuing to operate thanks to a bailout from the German government. Swedish travel company Ving, which is also owned by Thomas Cook is also still running flights. It is good news for the Canary Islands, where more than two-thirds of rooms for the next season have been booked by the Scandinavian market.\nWorkers in the Canary Islands are worried about how the collapse of Thomas Cook will affect their jobs. \u201cLast week we were full, and now look,\u201d says Lorenzo Naranjo, a multilingual waiter at the restaurant La Ciudadela in the seaside promenade of Playa del Ingl\u00e9s beach, pointing at the empty tables. \u201cNot even one English person,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are five waiters and this work could be done with just three.\u201d\nJos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Ram\u00edrez, a spokesperson from the labor union UGT, is urging calm. \u201cHaving 25% of the market does not mean 25% of jobs will be lost. I think the market is going to have the capacity to immediately fill a large part of what has been lost.\u201d\nThe regional premier of the Canary Islands, \u00c1ngel V\u00edctor Torres, said on Saturday that companies affected by the collapse of Thomas Cook could temporarily postpone their Social Security contributions as a way of protecting jobs.\nHow well hotels are able to bounce back in time for the next season will depend on how dependent they were on Thomas Cook. Local tourism owes a lot to large tour companies \u2013 streets have even been named after the travel giants In the town of Maspalomas in Gran Canaria. The hotel Mirador de Atl\u00e1ntico, in Amadores beach, for instance, worked exclusively with Thomas Cook. On Thursday, only around 20 of the 118 hotel rooms were booked, forcing the owners to move the remaining guests to another establishment and close down the hotel. They hope to reopen when Scandinavian clients arrive within two weeks. In the meantime, staying open means losing money.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/01/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
