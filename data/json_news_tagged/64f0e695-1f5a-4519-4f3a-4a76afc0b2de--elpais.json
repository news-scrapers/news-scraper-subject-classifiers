Not to mention the olives. And the croquetas. And the shrimp. You are starting to see condensation form on your beer mug and soon there\u2019s a puddle of water on the table. But no matter how many napkins you pull out of the holder, they are useless against the elements. What\u2019s worse, you now face a pile of scrunched-up paper that you don\u2019t know what to do with.\nYou know exactly who to blame: those useless napkins found at Spanish bars that don\u2019t absorb a single drop of liquid. But why on Earth do these anti-napkins still exist?\nI don\u2019t know whether there is a single Spaniard who hasn\u2019t come across these infernal napkins at one point or another. So let\u2019s find out their real name. The industry knows them as \u201csulfite paper napkins, glazed on one side.\u201d When they come in those flat holders, they are referred to as \u201czigzag napkins\u201d because of the way each one is folded into the previous one. And when they come in the vertical holders \u2013 you know, the kind where you try to pull one out and around 30 come out at the same time \u2013 they are called \u201cminiservis,\u201d just like the spring-activated container that holds them.\nI haven\u2019t learned all of these things due to a lifetime of going to bars and getting hopelessly filthy. I found them out from talking to Pablo Aguilella, who works at Caricias, a firm that makes napkins, tablecloths, coasters and, yes, miniservis. \u201cLet me tell you right now, I can\u2019t figure out why these are still sold,\u201d says Aguilella. \u201cThere are cheaper alternatives, such as cellulose tissue, which actually dries and cleans.\u201d\nThe average wholesale price of the anti-napkins is around \u20ac25 for a pack of 12,000, which is \u20ac0.002 per unit. According to Aguilella, it\u2019s not about the price, it\u2019s about the look. \u201cEach bar personalizes them with their own logo, which looks better on glazed paper.\u201d\nTo him, the obvious alternative would be the two-layer, 20x20cm napkins that are typically used as coasters under a drink, to prevent a ring from forming on the countertop. \u201cThose have a slightly rough feel that is ultimately what does the job of cleaning.\u201d\nFor better or for worse, Aguilella informs me that there are hardly any manufacturers left in the world that still make the so-called zigzag napkins, which have edges decorated with planes, chains and other motifs. What\u2019s popular now are products marketed as environmentally friendly. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen more than 300% growth in these products,\u201d he says.\nOver at Comercial El Ma\u00f1o, a supplier of the food and beverage industry, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Montol\u00edo confirms that there\u2019s been a significant drop in sales of anti-napkins. \u201cI am barely selling any, and the buyers are old-fashioned businesses whose owners ignore our recommendations for other products. These have fallen into disuse.\u201d\nMontol\u00edo notes that even though recycled napkins are selling better than ever, they have always existed. \u201cNow they come in a brown color, without the chlorine treatment to whiten them.\u201d\nAt this point, you may be wondering what\u2019s going on in Spain for us to cling to these anti-napkins. But we are not alone. This article published in Argentina\u2019s La Naci\u00f3n also complains about the plague of anti-napkins, which are common in that country\u2019s pizzerias and bars. And it\u2019s a similar story in Poland, as the blogger Pepe Mansilla rightfully laments.\nBut some people choose to look beyond functionality, and see potential in these products. The Madrid photographer Felipe Hern\u00e1ndez has been running an Instagram account about napkins (@servilletas) for the last two years. Although he is guided by esthetics, he has the following to say: \u201cThose napkins encapsulate Spain\u2019s gastronomic culture, its territorial differences; in short, the nation\u2019s graphic identity.\u201d\nAnd there is no lover of Spanish food culture who can resist passing fashions quite like Alberto Garc\u00eda Moyano (@enocasionesveobares). A lawyer, co-owner of the eateries Bodega Carol and Sants Es Crema, founder of Bodega Montferry and a know-nearly-all on all things bar-related, he has the following to say about the anti-napkins: \u201cThey seem like perhaps the most useless item in the world to me. Yet at the same time I am inordinately fond of them \u2013 I love seeing them, I think it\u2019s such a nice gesture on the bar owner\u2019s part. It\u2019s probably to do with nostalgia.\u201d\nI have a theory of my own that I share with Garc\u00eda Moyano: for several years now, I\u2019ve entertained the thought that these anti-napkins could be a good sign, a sign that the bar that has them does something well. \u201cSeeing a bar with this kind of napkin draws me in,\u201d agrees Garc\u00eda Moyano. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re making a statement:\u2018I have these napkins and there\u2019s a reason for it \u2013 because there\u2019s something in here that I know you might like.\u2019 And I\u2019m not talking about posers, but about people who might be more naturally inclined to go to these kinds of establishments.\u201d\nGarc\u00eda Moyano also has good things to say about the liquid-repellent qualities of the anti-napkin. \u201cThat kind of material is more useful than you think. The fact that they are slightly waterproof means that there\u2019s a 99.99% chance that if you wrap a sandwich in them, as we do at Bodega Montferry, the fricandeau sauce will not soak through.\u201d (Yes my friends, Bodega Montferry makes fricandeau sandwiches and many other marvelous things besides).\n\u201cI get really upset when a sandwich that\u2019s oozing delicious fat or sauce gets wrapped in those super-absorbent napkins. It\u2019s as though they were swallowing up food meant for me! The glazed napkin, instead, gives it back to you so you can eat it. And that\u2019s a wonderful thing, because you get a 100% return on your investment in a great, big, honking, dripping sandwich,\u201d he continues, rapturously. \u201cAs a matter of fact, these napkins deserve global gratitude from all of civilization.\u201d\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/03/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
