For the world\u2019s ultra-wealthy, it\u2019s an option\n\nWhile some tourists do Madrid on a shoestring, a select few see a side to the city well beyond the reach of the masses.\nLuxury tourism is now an activity that might include a visit to the Prado Museum cleared of fellow visitors, cooking classes with a famous chef, a private bullfight, paying the best jam\u00f3n carver in the world for a romantic dinner, and going for tapas with the king\u2019s cousin.\nRecognized in the industry as a high-net-worth visitor, the luxury tourist will be waited on hand and foot after arriving on a private jet and will enjoy door-to-door transportation with a private chauffeur.\nMaite Pinedo, a history of art lecturer, will never forget taking a New Yorker on a private tour of the Prado for a cool \u20ac4,300. Her charge spent the entire time in front of Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s Las Meninas \u2013 a picture she had dreamed all her life of seeing up close. In the event, she burst out crying.\nPinedo also took film director Martin Scorsese around the Prado; he wanted to see nothing more than three crucifixions \u2013 one by Vel\u00e1zquez, one by Goya and one by El Greco. He spent just five minutes looking at each one and was back on the street in 15 minutes. Pinedo also recalls a wealthy Chinese collector who stood in front of each and every painting in the gallery. \u201cIncluding those by Guido Reni!\u201d she says. \u201cAnd everyone gives those a wide berth!\u201d\nNot far from the Prado is The Westin Palace hotel. One week in its royal suite costs \u20ac18,000. The price covers picking the guest up in a private jet and bringing them to the hotel, dinner at a two-starred Michelin restaurant and the services of a stylist who will do their hair and makeup daily.\nAccording to Virginia Irurita, founder of the luxury travel agency Made for Spain and Portugal, Madrid is about to become the go-to destination for the high-end traveler. \u201c2020 will be its year,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are opening the Four Seasons, the Mandarin Oriental \u2013 previously The Ritz \u2013 and the W. And almost certainly the Museum of Royal Collections will be inaugurated next year. The luxury package is expanding.\u201d\nFilm director Martin Scorsese spent 15 minutes at the Prado, where he just looked at three crucifixions\nIrurita offers bespoke holidays in the true sense of the word. At the request of a Jewish couple wanting their children to learn about some of the heroes that came out of the Holocaust, she arranged a meeting with the granddaughter of \u00c1ngel Sanz-Briz, the Spanish diplomat who saved thousands of Hungarian Jews from death in 1944. Meanwhile, one US multi-millionaire spent a day playing dominoes with locals in a town between Seville and Granada, where she also spent hours on the slot machines. \u201cIt was one of the five best days of my life,\u201d she later wrote in a description of her vacation.\nOther attractions include master classes with famous chefs and ham connoisseurs. And, for those who are eager to rub shoulders with the nobility, Irurita organizes a tapas night with a member of the Borb\u00f3n royal family for \u20ac1,000.\nThese high rollers have an annual income of at least \u20ac197,000, according to the Spanish Luxury Association, and usually fall into one of the following five categories: Senior Bombers \u2013 active seniors; Adultescents \u2013 Peter Pan types; Nouveau Riche; Bobos \u2013 from the French \u201cbourgeois boh\u00e8mes\u201d; and Dinkys \u2013 a couple with two salaries and no children (an acronym for \u201cdual income, no kids yet\u201d).\nFor those fascinated by Spain\u2019s bullfighting tradition, there is also the possibility of visiting ranches such as the Mat\u00edas Carretero finca. On one occasion at least, visitors have wanted to see a bullfight in private. If the visitor has experience in the ring, as is the case for one Mexican tourist who turns up every year, they can don a cape and pit their wits against the animal.\nOne US multi-millionaire spent a day playing dominoes with locals in a town between Seville and Granada\nThis could cost around \u20ac1,800 for a young bull, though the most extravagant private bullfight was organized 10 years ago for a couple of Russian businessmen who paid \u20ac36,000 to watch the proceedings in El Casar bullring in Guadalajara. The spectacle was rounded out with a live band, a couple of Civil Guards and a crowd for atmosphere. \u201cThe place filled up with pensioners and people who were just curious,\u201d recalls the bullfighter Jes\u00fas de Alba, one of the two who performed that morning.\nAlso on the luxury agenda is Florencio Sanchidri\u00e1n, who wields his knives with all the passion of a bullfighter. Considered the best ham carver in the world, he frequently entertains wealthy tourists who want to savor Spain\u2019s world-renowned delicacy and has earned a certain celebrity status himself by cutting ham for Obama and the Pope, with one of his tastings costing between \u20ac3,000 and \u20ac4,000. He will also cut for couples wanting a romantic dinner, with different cuts of ham accompanied by different wines.\n\u201cIt is an intellectual tasting,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s technical. Bringing out the aroma of the ham requires all five senses.\u201d One day, when he believed his work was not up to scratch, he asked his clients\u2019 forgiveness. \u201cI was not up to the standard of the ham,\u201d he recalls.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/09/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
