Every day he gets a good brush, is dressed with saddle bags and woolen garments and goes out to work with his colleagues: Torete, Farruco, Molinero and Pajarito. A team of 69 donkeys makes up the donkey-ride service in Mijas (M\u00e1laga), and it is one of the key tourist activities in the area. The business has just updated its regulations to improve its animal welfare, with one of the most notable measures of this \u201cworkers\u2019 statute\u201d stating that neither Camar\u00f3n, nor any of the other animals, can carry an adult who weighs more than 80 kilograms on their backs during their regular rides in the village\u2019s historical quarter.\n\u201cThe regulations were outdated,\u201d explains Nicol\u00e1s Cruz, the local councilor for transport and urban mobility. The document has now been brought into line with European animal-protection legislation. It is also in response to the complaints from many residents and tourists, especially those from the north of Europe, who can\u2019t understand why donkey and horse rides are still a tourist attraction in southern Spain. \u201cThe new laws are also important to present a modern society that respects the welfare of animals,\u201d said Cruz.\nThe new laws are also important to present a modern society that respects the welfare of animals\nNicol\u00e1s Cruz, Councilor of Transport and Urban Mobility\nThe new regulations, which are expected to be approved at the beginning of 2020, also include working hours: from 9am to 6pm in the fall and winter, and 8.30am to 9.30pm in spring and summer, with a mandatory rest between 2pm and 5pm. The animals will also work shifts. \u201cThose who are on in the morning will not work in the afternoon and vice versa,\u201d explains the order, which has also established a minimum working age of three. The life expectancy of a donkey is between 30 and 35 years.\nThe text contains various improvements to the conditions of the stable yard, such as the obligatory existence of a first-aid kit and space for the donkeys to lie down, play and roam around. Equally, there are plans to improve the hygiene conditions of the stables and the stalls. The animals will have to have access to water 24 hours a day and the rope used to tie them up should have a minimum length of 30 centimeters so that they can move their head and swat away flies. The donkey handlers, for their part, will have to wear appropriate uniforms.\n\u201cThese conditions were more or less being met already, but now they have a regulatory framework and are therefore punishable,\u201d explains the Dean of the M\u00e1laga Lawyers Association, Francisco Javier Lara, one of the driving forces behind the initiative. The Grupo Animalista de Benalm\u00e1dena (Benalm\u00e1dena Animal Group), La Asociaci\u00f3n Andaluza contra la Intolerancia Animal (the Andalusian Association against Animal Cruelty) and El Refugio del Burrito (the Donkey Sanctuary) have also been working with the council for a decade on this issue.\nTheir suggestions have formed part of a working-practices agreement, one that used to only be a recommendation. Now many of the points made by these groups have become part of the regulations. \u201cIt is a fundamental step, as is the local council making sure that the rules are met,\u201d says Ver\u00f3nica S\u00e1nchez, director of The Donkey Sanctuary. The council has also committed to increasing veterinary inspections and controls. Fines for failure to comply with the regulations will vary from \u20ac750 to \u20ac3,000.\nSalvador Torres is one of the donkey handlers in Mijas. He owns 10 donkeys, one of which is Camar\u00f3n. \u201cWe think everything that tries to improve their welfare is great,\u201d he says, although he complains that he was not able to be part of the committee that discussed the regulations. He also brushes off the complaints about the donkeys\u2019 excessive workload. \u201cThey practically rest all day,\u201d he explains, while waiting for customers in the Plaza V\u00edrgen de la Pe\u00f1a in Mijas Town.\nThe donkey rides in Mijas are among the most-criticized services by Spain\u2019s animal rights party PACMA\nThe service acts as a taxi: when one of the donkeys finishes their walk they go to the back of the line to wait for their next turn. During the summer, Easter and other holidays every donkey goes out to work three or four times a day. In the winter, they go out just once a week. The rest of their time is spent in the shade, \u201cwaiting in the stalls or resting in the nearby stables,\u201d according to Alejandro Trisoe, who has worked with these animals for a decade.\nThe business is simple. The walking trail costs \u20ac15 for a quarter of an hour. A trip in the donkey-pulled-cart costs \u20ac20 for two people for the same amount of time. \u201cIt draws a lot of attention among the British and Japanese,\u201d said Torres. These are two of the most common nationalities seen coming out of the crowded buses that arrive at the area daily, with visitors from all over the world.\nThe donkey rides in Mijas are among the most-criticized services by Spain\u2019s animal rights party PACMA, which has denounced the business practices on different occasions. The last of these was in 2018 after the death of one of the donkeys in its stable in \u201cagonizing conditions,\u201d according to the group. The party is demanding \u201ca ban on the use of animals for tourist transport.\u201d However, until this happens, Camar\u00f3n will continue to work, but now in better conditions than ever before.\nEnglish version by Alicia Kember.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/15/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
