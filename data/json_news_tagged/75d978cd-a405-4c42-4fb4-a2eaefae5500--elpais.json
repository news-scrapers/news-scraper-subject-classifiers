On Thursday, the head of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, called on the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, to help the migrants.\nIf Europe cannot protect migrants at sea, it will mean that it has lost its soul, as well as its heart\nEU Parliament chief David Sassoli\n\u201cThe situation is serious and calls for immediate action,\u201d he wrote in a letter, published in Italy\u2019s leading newspaper La Reppublica. According to Sassoli, if Europe cannot protect migrants at sea, \u201cit will mean that it has lost its soul, as well as its heart.\u201d\nSince June last year, authorities in Malta and Italy have banned rescue ships carrying migrants from docking at their ports unless a previous agreement existed to relocate the migrant to other countries.\nThe EU has been unable to make Italy and Malta change their position, nor has it come up with a reliable strategy for providing rescue boats with safe ports. In cases where a rescue ship is denied entry, like the Open Arms, the European Commission acts as a mediator between member states. The process is unpredictable, slow, and forces boats to spend up to three weeks at sea waiting for authorization to dock. What\u2019s more, the process cannot begin unless requested by an EU member state.\nPor fin una peque\u00f1a buena noticia.Llegan v\u00edveres al #OpenArms y contamos con un compa\u00f1ero de tripulaci\u00f3n excepcional #RichardGere #PuertoSeguroYa pic.twitter.com/IgrTZyU6KI\nAt last some good news. Supplies arrive and we have the support of an exceptional crew member Richard Gere.\nThe director of the NGO Proactiva Open Arms, \u00d3scar Camps, formally appealed to Spain, France and Germany to activate negotiations on Thursday, but no action was taken. On Wednesday, acting Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo, of the Socialist Party (PSOE), said Spain would not intervene in the case: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do it.\u201d\nThe Spanish rescue ship is currently 29 nautical miles from the Lampedusa. Camps arrived on the Italian island on Thursday afternoon to keep track of developments, accompanied by Hollywood actor Richard Gere who has gone to support the cause. The head of the Barcelona-based charity has welcomed Sassoli\u2019s letter, calling it \u201ccompelling.\u201d \u201cYou have to admit he is right. If Europe cannot protect people who search for a better life it will mean Europe has lost its soul and its heart,\u201d he added from the island.\nThe EU Commission is expected to reply to Sassoli on Friday morning, but late on Thursday, a spokesperson insisted that the executive branch cannot mediate unless a member state requests its intervention.\nM.M.\nThe 121 migrants aboard the Open Arms rescue ship are getting anxious to reach solid ground. \u201cThere is a lot of dizziness and several of them are vomiting,\u201d says Francisco Gentico, one of the volunteers on board. The ship is carrying nine-month twins and another 30 minors. There are also migrants with serious injuries.\nThe story of Safa, a Sudanese woman, who fled to Libya aged 12 with her two sisters and mother, has made a particularly strong impact on the Open Arms crew. In Libya, irregular immigration is a crime and trafficking and exploiting migrants is a lucrative business. For nine months, Safa was locked up with her family in a detention center, where they suffered all types of harassment, aggression and abuse. \u201cOften, when they would come for her mother or her sisters, she [Safa] would sacrifice herself and asked that they rape her to protect them,\u201d says Gentico.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/09/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
