The country\u2019s Health Ministry has activated alert and communication systems with the European authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) \u201cgiven the possibility that cases might be detected in other countries.\u201d The move, according to ministerial sources, is a precaution in case any tourists visiting the country may have contracted the infection after consuming contaminated pork products in Spain. So far there have been no registered cases outside of the country.\nThe current outbreak of the bacterial infection has its source in a pork loin product, known in Spanish as \u2018carne mechada\u2019\nThe current outbreak of the bacterial infection has its source in a pork product known in Spanish as carne mechada, sold under the brand name La Mech\u00e1, and produced by the Seville-based company Magrudis S.L.. Carne mechada is made with pork loin cooked in its own fat. The lard is inserted into the meat using an instrument called a larding needle, or mechadora in Spanish. The finished product is usually served cold, in slices.\nOn Wednesday, the health chief in Andalusia, Jes\u00fas Aguirre, confirmed that there are 132 cases in the southern Spanish region, as well as four more in neighboring Extremadura, and three in each of the following regions: Catalonia, Asturias and Arag\u00f3n. The total number of infections currently stands at 145, with the number of suspected cases \u2013 i.e. people with symptoms compatible with listeriosis but who are yet to be positively diagnosed \u2013 as high as 529.\nA total of 53 people \u2013 including 23 pregnant women \u2013 are currently hospitalized in Andalusia due to the bacterial infection, three of whom are in intensive care. So far, one person has died from the outbreak: a 90-year-old woman who passed away in the early hours of Monday in a Seville hospital. In other regions, the most important case involves a \u201cpremature newborn whose mother consumed carne mechada in a bar in Madrid in July,\u201d the Health Ministry announced on Wednesday.\nListeriosis is a bacterial infection that can cause severe illnesses such as sepsis, meningitis and encephalitis, and can even be fatal. Those most at risk are the elderly, unborn babies and newborns, or people whose immune systems are compromised. The infection can also cause gastroenteritis and fever. It is primarily transmitted, as in this current outbreak in Spain, by the ingestion of contaminated foods.\nListeriosis is a bacterial infection that can cause severe illnesses such as sepsis, meningitis and encephalitis, and can even be fatal\nThe severity of the crisis has prompted the Andalusian regional premier, Juan Manuel Moreno, to cut short his summer vacation in order to preside over a government committee that will be monitoring the outbreak.\nOn August 14, Seville City Council, run by the Socialist Party (PSOE), took the \u201cprecautionary\u201d measure of halting production at the Magrudis factory. From that same day onward, the Andalusian regional government \u2013 which is in the hands of the conservative Popular Party (PP) and center-right Ciudadanos, with the support of far-right Vox \u2013 limited itself to ordering the pork loin products off the shelves but allowed for the continued sale of other products from the company. Supermarkets such as Alcampo, meanwhile, withdrew all of the firm\u2019s products from its shelves.\nThe regional government waited five days before taking the product off the market\nThe regional government waited until Wednesday of this week before ordering all products from Magrudis to be taken off the market. These include lomos, a kind of preserved pork loin, and chicharrones, or pork belly. Experts such as Jos\u00e9 Juan Rodr\u00edguez, a professor in nutrition and bromatology at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, have expressed surprise at the decisions taken by the regional government. \u201cWith the existing evidence that points to the contamination of the pork loin having taken place in the factory, it would have been recommendable to withdraw all of the [company\u2019s] products,\u201d he said.\nThe regional government also waited five days before taking the product off the market, despite being aware on August 9 that two samples analyzed had returned a \u201chighly positive\u201d result. The Junta, as the regional government is known, admitted on Wednesday to a \u201ctwo or three\u201d day delay, but regional official El\u00edas Bendodo blamed this on Seville City Hall, accusing the municipal laboratory that carries out such analyses for the Junta of having mixed up the meat samples, something that the local authority denies. City Hall has defended its management of the crisis and has insisted that the samples of meat from different companies that it received were incorrectly labeled.\nThe acting health minister, Mar\u00eda Luisa Carcedo, waded into the controversy after stating that some procedures must have failed for the outbreak to become the biggest ever seen in Spain. \u201cThere will now have to be inspections and probes, which will have to be carried out by the civil servants in the Andalusian Junta, because this is a regional competence,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we will find out where the failure was. But obviously [a failure] has taken place because the established procedures are designed so that this does not happen.\u201d\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/22/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
