The PSOE rode the wave of public anger to lead a successful no-confidence motion against the conservative government of then-Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who was unseated and replaced by current caretaker Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez of the PSOE.\nToday\u2019s convictions in the ERE case are providing fresh ammunition in the PP-PSOE battle over corruption.\nSo what are the differences and similarities between the two judicial probes, both of which have damaged the image of Spain\u2019s two main political parties?\nThe mechanism. The G\u00fcrtel case was \u201ca veritable and efficient system of institutional corruption through mechanisms aimed at manipulating public contracts,\u201d according to the main ruling in a case that was broken up into several separate probes.\nThe ERE case is a system of public subsidies for struggling companies that deliberately bypassed preliminary oversight by the regional government\u2019s comptroller. This enabled funds to be irregularly channeled to dozens of workers and companies for an entire decade, according to the investigation.\nEconomic impact. In the G\u00fcrtel case, the businesses controlled by the ringleader, Francisco Correa, benefited from rigged government contracts and from commissions charged for mediating in business transactions involving PP administrations. The G\u00fcrtel probe found that more than \u20ac20 million in public contracts were compromised, although this amount could be much higher when other pending cases enter the trial stage. One of these side probes is investigating the PP\u2019s parallel accounts, where former treasurer Luis B\u00e1rcenas took note of corporate donations between 1993 and 2009 worth over \u20ac8 million, all of it undeclared to tax authorities.\nIn the ERE case, the companies in charge of managing the insurance policies for early retirement payments overcharged in excess of \u20ac66 million for their services\nIn the ERE case, the companies in charge of managing the insurance policies for early retirement payments overcharged in excess of \u20ac66 million for their services, the probe shows. At least 141 of the 6,000 employees who benefited from the aid were not in fact working for the companies undergoing collective dismissal (ERE) procedures, representing a fraud of around \u20ac12 million, according to the investigation. These two amounts were not part of Tuesday\u2019s ruling and will be dealt with at separate trials. Today\u2019s ruling includes a graph with the amount of money allocated between 2000 and 2009 by the fraudulent system, which adds up to \u20ac680 million.\nIllegal party financing. In the G\u00fcrtel case, the court found that part of the money earned by the corrupt network through rigged contracts was used to pay for some of the PP\u2019s campaign events, meaning that there was illegal party financing.\nIn the ERE case, investigators uncovered favorable treatment for companies in specific municipalities run by the PSOE, or for businesses owned by former PSOE leaders. There is no indication that there was illegal party financing, even though the first investigating judge, Mercedes Alaya, suggested as much without citing any evidence.\nIllicit personal gain by politicians. One of the key figures to be convicted at the main G\u00fcrtel trial is Alberto L\u00f3pez Viejo, who was a high-ranking official in the Madrid regional government. He was found guilty of taking illegal commissions in exchange for awarding contracts.\nIn the ERE case, neither the two former regional premiers nor their department chiefs have been accused of personal gain as a result of the way they handled the public subsidies for struggling companies.\nPrison terms. In the G\u00fcrtel case, five former high-ranking officials from the PP (one member of Congress, two mayors and two treasurers) received lengthy prison sentences. Another 24 people were sentenced to jail. The ruling also found the PP itself, as a legal entity, guilty of benefiting from the crimes that were committed by the corrupt network.\nTen people have been given prison terms for misuse of public funds in the ERE case, including former regional premier Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gri\u00f1\u00e1n and two ex-department chiefs, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Viera and Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez. Meanwhile, another former regional premier, Manuel Chaves, has been barred from holding public office for nine years.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/19/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
