But if there is a no-deal Brexit, current conditions will only remain in place if British authorities extend reciprocal treatment to Spaniards in the United Kingdom.\nRegional officials had asked the ministry to clarify the situation in light of the uncertainty over Brexit\nOn Monday, Spanish Health Minister Mar\u00eda Luisa Carcedo met with regional health authorities to remind them of the measures set out in a contingency plan that was approved by the government in March of this year.\nIn Spain, healthcare management is devolved to the regions, and several regional officials had asked the ministry to clarify the situation in light of the uncertainty over Brexit. The head of the health department for the Balearic Islands, Patricia G\u00f3mez, had expressed particular concern due to the large numbers of British tourists who visit the region. In statements to the media, G\u00f3mez said she would like for everything to stay \u201cexactly the same,\u201d and she has volunteered to create a Brexit follow-up committee, according to the news agency Europa Press.\nThe Health Ministry has created a webpage with information for private citizens and agency officials alike. The site lists several common scenarios that British nationals might find themselves in, and explains how to proceed in each case.\nFor instance, if a British tourist travels to Spain post-Brexit, will he or she be covered by public healthcare during the stay? If the British parliament ratifies the agreement with the EU, the answer is yes, and all that will be required is a European Health Insurance Card. But if there is no departure deal, coverage will only be guaranteed during temporary stays as long as \u201cSpanish citizens receive reciprocal treatment in the UK.\u201d\nAs for British nationals working in Spain, nothing will change because Spanish legislation guarantees healthcare access to any employee signed up to the social security system. As for their families, they will need a residency permit and they will have to be living in Spain in order to maintain their healthcare benefits.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/16/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
