The country\u2019s Public Works Ministry has established minimum services aimed at alleviating the disruption, which will coincide with the return of many travelers from their August vacation.\nRyanair said that all passengers affected by the cancellations have received notifications via email or text message of the options available\nDespite its cabin crew planning 10 days of strikes for September, with pilots also staging stoppages on five of the same days, Ryanair has only canceled 14 flights of the 1,900 scheduled to and from Spain for the first two days of the industrial action. It has pulled six flights on September 1, and eight on September 2.\nThe airline explained that this low number \u2013 just 0.7% of the total flights for the two days \u2013 is possible \u201cthanks to the great work of the majority of our Spanish pilots and cabin crew who have already confirmed that they will continue to operate according to their planned timetables, or are offering to work on their days off, with the aim of not altering the travel plans of our customers and their families in September.\u201d\nThe Irish carrier added that all those passengers affected by the cancellations have been sent notifications via email or text message of the options available to them, which include a free flight change or a complete refund. Passengers who have not received these notifications will be able to fly.\nRyanair has called on the USO and Sitcpla unions, which represent cabin crew, and the SEPLA union, which represents pilots, to call off the planned stoppages, which have been called over the airline\u2019s plans to close a number of its bases across Spain and Portugal.\nSpain\u2019s Public Works Ministry has already set minimum service levels for the first cabin crew strike days, protecting all of the flights to the Canary and Balearic Islands, 60% of the flights within the peninsula and to international destinations where the flight time is five hours or above, and 35% of flights within the peninsula with a flight time below five hours\nFollowing the last failed meeting between Iberia management and union leaders, ground staff will walk off the job on August 30 and 31 at Madrid-Barajas and Barcelona-El Prat. The company has cancelled 102 flights \u2013 six departing from Barcelona and the rest from Madrid.\nFor its part, Vueling has canceled 92 flights this weekend at the Barcelona-El Prat airport, due to the strike called by Iberia ground staff.
