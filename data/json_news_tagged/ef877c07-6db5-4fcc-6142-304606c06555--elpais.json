It is 9.40am and dozens of people are waiting to board the next train. Suddenly a man kicks a passenger from behind onto the tracks just as a train is approaching.\nThe incident took place on Friday, August 2, in Madrid, causing panic and fright among bystanders. With no apparent motive, the aggressor approached his victim, a 23-year-old man, and kicked him in front of the train. Fortunately, the victim reacted quickly, rolling to one side and flattening himself under the platform\u2019s overhang which saved his life.\nTensions ran high as bystanders waited to see if the victim had survived and those close to the alleged aggressor restrained him until the station\u2019s security guards arrived on the scene. After handcuffing the man, the security forces proceeded to inform the national police and Samur emergency ambulance service of the incident.\nOnce the train had passed, the victim lifted his head and clambered onto the platform with the help of bystanders. Although the incident could have been fatal, the 23-year-old escaped with only minor injuries on his elbow and right forearm.\nThe alleged assailant is a 27-year-old Brazilian man named Bruno. After the unprovoked attack he was taken to the police station in Chamber\u00ed and on Saturday, a judge ordered him to be held on remand without bail on a charge of attempted manslaughter.\nAccording to his sources close to the investigation, Bruno has already been involved in a number of disturbances this summer with two arrests for causing bodily harm and another for attacking officers of the law.\nOn June 7, Bruno was arrested for instigating a conflict in an outdoor bar on Poblados avenue in the south of Madrid. Without any apparent motive, he destroyed the bar\u2019s furnishings and, when criticized by the owner, lashed out at him and nearby customers, fracturing one patron\u2019s elbow. When the police were called, they had some difficulty restraining and arresting him.\nOne month later, on July 10, Bruno caused another disturbance in the center of Madrid on Preciados street, flicking the butt of his cigarette into a passing police patrol vehicle, which had its windows down. The officers got out and approached Bruno who again resisted arrest, kicking and punching the police officers who eventually managed to restrain him and take him to the police station in central Madrid where he was charged with causing bodily harm and attacking police officers.\nGiven his track record of unprovoked attacks on strangers, police sources believe that Bruno is suffering from a psychological disorder.\nWhile the victim of the Metro incident last Friday emerged relatively unscathed, similar incidents have produced a very different outcome. In October 2005, for example, when 23-year-old Jorge R. V. pushed Miriam Alonso Corraliza onto the tracks at Carabanchel Metro station, the approaching train amputated her left leg and a toe on her right foot as well as breaking her hip and seriously injuring her face. Her aggressor, who lived in Fuenlabrada, was sentenced to 11 years in a psychiatric unit.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/05/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
