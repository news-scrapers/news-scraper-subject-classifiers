But less attention has been given to the four foreign dictators who are also buried in the Spanish capital.\nThe oldest burial ground in Madrid, San Isidro cemetery (which dates back to 1811), is the resting place for two autocrats. The first is General Fulgencio Batista, the former president of Cuba, who governed the Caribbean island with an iron fist from 1952 until 1959, when he was ousted by Fidel Castro. Batista tried to hold on to power by torturing and murdering his opponents. He is buried beside his wife and son under a plain granite tombstone, adorned by nothing more than a boxwood shrub. Neither the Cuban flag or its colors mark the grave of the dictator who, after his ouster, \u201cspent the rest of his life talking about Cuba and dreaming of returning, at least once before his death,\u201d says his son Bobby Batista by telephone from New York, adding that there is only a \u201cvery remote\u201d possibility that his father\u2019s body will be repatriated to Cuba.\nAccording to Bobby Batista, Franco initially refused to give Batista political asylum in the beginning of 1959. But after the political maelstrom, the dictator relented and gave him a visa. Batista lived in Estoril in Portugal, which at the time was ruled by the dictator Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar, and traveled regularly to Spain, where, Bobby says, the government always gave him two security guards for protection. \u201cGeneral Franco treated my father very well,\u201d he adds. Fulgencio Batista died in Marbella, in the south of Spain, in 1973 and was buried in San Isidro.\nIn another section of the same cemetery lies the grave of someone whose name probably means little to many, but is the source of great pain to others: Ante Paveli\u0107.\nPaveli\u0107 was the head of the Independent State of Croatia (1941-1945), a fascist puppet state of Nazi Germany, but no less brutal. According to Hrvoje Klasi\u0107, a history professor at the University of Zagreb, between 200,000 and 300,000 people were killed under Paveli\u0107\u2019s regime.\nThe following scene gives an insight into the dictator\u2019s style of rule. The German-Italian journalist Curzio Malaparte was interviewing Paveli\u0107 in his office when he noticed a basket with the lid half-off. Malaparte thought the contents were fresh molluscs and asked the dictator if they were oysters. According to the journalist, \u201cPaveli\u0107 took off the lid [and] took out a handful of viscous and gelatinous oysters, and giving me one of his smiles filled with kindness and weariness, said: \u2018This is a present from my loyal Ustache [Croatian ultranationalist fighters]: 20 kilos of human eyes.\u201d\nAfter the Allied Forces defeated Germany, Paveli\u0107 managed to escape to Argentina, where Army General Juan Per\u00f3n was serving as president. He suffered an attack on his life in 1955, and two years later was granted asylum by Franco\u2019s Spain. Paveli\u0107 died in 1959. The last time he left the house was to visit the recently-opened Valley of the Fallen.\nAround 30 kilometers north of here, at La Paz cemetery, lies the grave of Venezuelan dictator Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez, who ruled between 1952 and 1958 and was praised by the Franco-controlled press for his economic development policies, to which he added political repression and corruption. He fled to Santo Domingo so quickly that \u201che forgot a suitcase with $13 million in cash on the runway,\u201d according to Argentine journalist Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez, and was later extradited by the US to Venezuela, where he was sent to prison. After being released in 1968, he moved to Madrid, where under the protection of Franco, he enjoyed a life of luxury. P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez died in 2001 in his home in the upscale Madrid neighborhood of La Moraleja.\nAt El Pardo-Mingorrubio cemetery, where Franco\u2019s remains are being reburied, the notorious Dominican dictator Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo is buried in an ostentatious black pantheon. Trujillo, who ruled the Caribbean island for 30 years, was shot and killed in 1961 when his car was ambushed on a road outside the capital, Santo Domingo.\nHe was buried in the Dominican Republic until his family, fearing his grave would be vandalized, sent his remains to the P\u00e8re-Lachaise cemetery in Paris. Trujillo\u2019s coffin was then moved to Spain in 1970 to be buried in the pantheon of his son Ramfis, who had died months earlier in a car crash. Now, Franco and Trujillo will rest together in the same cemetery, not far from Paveli\u0107, Batista and P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/24/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
