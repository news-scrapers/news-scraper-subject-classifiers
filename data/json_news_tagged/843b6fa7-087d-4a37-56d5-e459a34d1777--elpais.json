L\u00e1zaro first began working at a bar when he was 11. Now, at age 90, he has been running Madrid\u2019s iconic Casa Amadeo \u201cLos Caracoles,\u201d in the La Latina neighborhood, for nearly half a century.\nQuestion. You\u2019ve been here a few years\u2026\nAnswer. A few years less than Cascorro square [where the bar is located].\nQ. The square is going to be renamed.\nI am a barman at heart, there is no secret\nA. After all I\u2019ve done, the square should be renamed after me.\nQ. What have you learned in this time?\nA. I\u2019m still learning! Because there is so much to learn. I have learned that it is a virtue to be friendly, warm, and humble when accepting people\u2018s money. You have to know how to hope and how to love.\nQ.That must be why you look so good for your age. Or does it have something to do with genetics?\nA. I believe that I have a certain degree of mental savviness. My brain\u2019s central receiver and transmitter work well.\nQ. Do you come here everyday or just on Sundays?\nA. I roam about, I do what I want. I\u2019m very young at heart, I feel like a child. Do you know what a child does? Divides little and adds a lot.\nQ. Is that why you have brought all your family to work at Casa Amadeo?\nA. I have seven children and three work there. I invited them with the best of intentions, I suggested it because the tavern is our livelihood. But this job requires patience, dedication and love.\nQ. And that is how you have been running your bar since you opened it in 1972.\nA. Not my bar! My taberna! I came to Madrid when I was 11 and started to work as a barman in this very square. In 1972, I bought this space to open my own tavern. I want to reiterate the difference between a bar and a tavern because, at the time, it was very clear. There is a social ladder. Taverns were more for the people, they had bar stools. In bars, there are chairs.\nI put my life, heart and soul into the snails\nQ. Your tavern still has an old-fashioned air, have you not wanted to modernize it?\nA. We are simple folk, we are not blue-blooded. We don\u2019t have anything against those who are, but we prefer people who don\u2018t come from a privileged background.\nQ. What is the secret to your success?\nA. I am a barman at heart, there is no secret. This influences your treatment, hospitality, gratitude and sociability. Spreading love guarantees unexpected and immeasurable rewards.\nQ. Your famous snails must have something to do with your success.\nA. Of course, I put my life, heart and soul into them. They are an oasis of life.\nQ. And the ingredients\u2026\nA. They have to be spicy, that's key. Chili pepper, paprika and a little chorizo.\nQ. Who taught you how to make them?\nA. My mother. I am from Burgos [in northern Spain] and snails are very popular there. I used to work with my mother, and that's how I learned. I learned little by little, and now they are very sought after.\nThis job requires patience, dedication and love\nQ. How many snails do you serve on a Sunday, your busiest day?\nA. Between 40 and 50 kilos. We need to work for up to five hours nonstop. On a normal day, we serve between 15 to 20 kilos.\nQ. You also help make the snails?\nA. I\u2019m in public relations. They don't let me in the ring anymore.\nQ. You have not retired.\nA. I like being [at the tavern], I greet everyone. I create an environment of warmth, of communication. I have an international way of being. I am loving and compassionate.\nQ. You\u2019re the boss then?\nA. Here I\u2019m the errand boy, I am not the boss, we are here to serve you.\nQ. Has a franchise ever tried to buy your business?\nA. Yes of course, there have been temptations. But this is the bread of God. Plus, my boys are here, and this is their livelihood. But, of course, it has to be done with love.\nQ. Have famous people come to meet you?\nA. Yes, people who have felt curious have come, because there are no bartenders like me anymore, I\u2019m a museum piece.\nCasa Amadeo used to be a canned goods shop and a hair salon. In 1972, Amadeo L\u00e1zaro bought the two stores and turned them into a taberna. He and his wife still live next door to the tavern, on the top floor of a building without an elevator in Santa Ana square. \u201cIt is where we raised all of our children and no vulture fund is going to make us leave,\u201d he says.\nEnglish version by Alicia Kember.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/22/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
