The hotel industry has not offered any figures, although some establishments in the city center admit they have had cancellations and lowered their rates. City officials said on Monday that tourists staying in downtown hotels were relocated elsewhere.\n\u201cThere was an operation that was negotiated with the hotel industry and which allowed us to relocate a significant number of affected tourists,\u201d said Xavier Marc\u00e9, chief of the local tourism department. Industry sources said that the disturbances have mostly affected bookings for the coming months, particularly at four- and five-star hotels.\nMeanwhile, the city of Barcelona has estimated the damage to street furniture at \u20ac2.7 million. Four stores were looted on Friday night: a branch of consumer electronics retailer Media Markt, the Vodafone store located at Portal del \u00c0ngel, and the sports apparel retailers AW LAB and Foot Locker. Several bank branches were broken into and furniture removed to build barricades.\nGabriel Jen\u00e9, president of Barcelona Oberta, said that the current situation is worse than on October 1, 2017, the day that an unauthorized independence referendum was held. \u201cBack then there were just a few days [of street unrest] but now it\u2019s different, because there are constant mobilizations and we don\u2019t know when they will end,\u201d he said.\nAt the political level, the week of disturbances has triggered calls for the kind of unity that remains elusive for now. Inside the Catalan parliament, separatist parties have yet to craft a common response to the Supreme Court ruling ahead of a plenary session on Wednesday. And Catalan regional premier Quim Torra\u2019s recent suggestion to hold a new unauthorized referendum before the end of the political term found no support in the chamber.\nCarme Forcadell, a former speaker of the Catalan parliament and one of the nine leaders to have been sentenced to prison for her role in the 2017 secession bid, said in radio statements that she feels \u201ca lot of anger\u201d at the division among separatist forces, and urged parties to seek agreements at \u201csuch a very, very serious\u201d juncture.\nSpeaking to Catalunya R\u00e0dio from the Mas d'Enric penitentiary in Catllar (Barcelona), where she is serving a sentence of 11 years and six months for sedition, Forcadell also said that politicians should condemn the violence of recent days \u201cforcefully and immediately.\u201d\n\u201cNon-violence is not just a matter of conviction, which it is, but also a matter of efficiency,\u201d said Forcadell, who admitted to crying when she saw television images of violence on the streets. \u201cI could not recognize Barcelona. People, no matter what they believe, have the right to leave their houses without having their cars torched or feeling scared when they\u2019re walking their children to school.\u201d\nNon-violence is not just a matter of conviction, which it is, but also a matter of efficiency\nCarme Forcadell, ex-speaker of Catalan parliament\nAt his first political rally following the week of protests, Spain\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez of the Socialist Party (PSOE), said that \u201cthe government is doing what it has to do. And it is doing it alone, because the head of the Generalitat [Catalan government] has not condemned violence and is not acknowledging the majority of Catalans who want to remain in Spain.\u201d\nS\u00e1nchez, who was in Barcelona on Monday morning but did not meet with Quim Torra, said that this will only happen when Torra \u201cfirst talks\u201d with non-separatist Catalans, as the Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) has requested.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/22/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
