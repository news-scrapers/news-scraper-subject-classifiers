The attack happened in broad daylight, when he began arguing with the woman because he wanted her to change seats and she refused.\n\u201cI won\u2019t hit you because you\u2019re a woman, but go back to your fucking country!\u201d the youth is heard saying in the video. The woman replies: \u201cThat would be the last straw, if you tried to lay a finger on me.\u201d The attacker laughs: \u201cWell, that would be equality.\u201d He is then seen closing in on the woman and shouting: \u201cYou have no shame, go back to your country!\u201d The woman replies: \u201cI am in my country,\u201d and he shouts back: \u201cThis isn\u2019t your country.\u201d\nYou have no shame, go back to your country!\nAnonymous attacker\nThe footage shows that as the woman is leaving the bus, the man hits her on the back and kicks her. The only person to react is the young man\u2019s female friend who shouts: \u201cArturo, stop there, stop now!\u201d Another one of the man\u2019s friends yells at the woman: \u201cOut! Out!.\u201d\nThe incident has not been reported to the police. The video was shared on the blog Es Racismo, an initiative of the association SOS Racismo, on November 2. According to this group, which claims to have spoken with the young woman who made the recording, the incident occurred on Thursday, October 31 just before 12.30pm on a bus on line 77, which runs between Ciudad Lineal and Colonia Fin de Semana.\n\u201c[The aggressor and his two companions] sat down in the seat in front [of the woman] and then the young man in the video told this woman to move because he wanted to sit there. She had about two stops left to go, so she didn't want to sit on the window-side, as she would be getting off soon,\u201d said this witness in statements to Es Racismo. According to her version of events, the victim got off at the Alcal\u00e1-Esfinge (3407) bus stop in Madrid\u2019s Canillejas neighborhood.\nThe Madrid transportation company says it has no record of the incident\n\u201cThe woman was with her husband, who was sitting in front of her. When the argument broke out, he got up and asked the young man to calm down and stop disrespecting his wife,\u201d the witness said. But \u201cthe young man started hitting the bus, making fun of the woman and even blowing her kisses,\u201d she said, adding that \u201ctwo children witnessed everything, and one girl started crying.\u201d\nA spokesperson from Madrid\u2019s municipal transportation company EMT told EL PA\u00cdS that they had \u201cno record\u201d of the event, and\u00a0 noted that the video was recorded \u201cby a private individual.\u201d The company has reviewed the footage recorded on all of the buses on line 77, both on that day and the days before and after, and have found nothing. There are three cameras on every bus, said this source. Nor has any driver reported an assault. A spokesperson from the National Police headquarters in Madrid told EL PA\u00cdS there is no record of\u00a0 a complaint of this kind being reported.\nThe video of the attack comes three months after the police arrested a man for a racist attack against a black woman on a bus in Madrid.\nEnglish version by Alicia Kember.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/06/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
