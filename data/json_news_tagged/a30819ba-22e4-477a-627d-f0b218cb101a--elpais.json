The Monday raids turned up equipment and instructions on how to make homemade explosives. Investigators believe the suspects may have been planning acts of violence to coincide with the second anniversary of the unauthorized independence referendum of October 1, 2017.\nSoon after separatist lawmakers expressed support for the suspects, Carlos Carrizosa, a representative of the non-separatist party Ciudadanos (Citizens) was expelled from the chamber after repeatedly telling pro-independence parliamentarians that \u201cwe feel threatened by those who back terrorism.\u201d\nHis fellow party members walked out with him, but they were not the first ones. Earlier, the four representatives of the anti-capitalist CUP party had left in protest over the judge\u2019s decision to keep the seven CDR suspects in preventive custody.\nThe caretaker Socialist Party (PSOE) government of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez is planning to mount legal appeals against some or all of the proposals seen in the Catalan parliament on Thursday evening, including the demand for the removal of the Civil Guard from the northeastern Spanish region.\nThe main purpose of the session was to debate and vote on a series of proposals, including one sponsored by the CUP that defends \u201cthe legitimacy of institutional and civil disobedience\u201d as a response to an upcoming Supreme Court decision in the trial of separatist leaders who headed the unilateral secession attempt of 2017. The motion passed with 69 votes in favor and 25 against. Thirty-five of the 36 lawmakers from Ciudadanos refused to vote.\nThe text also defends that \u201cthe parliament of Catalonia recognizes that Catalonia exercised its right to self-determination\u201d at the unauthorized referendum of October 1, 2017, which is defined as \u201clegitimate and legal.\u201d\nThe CUP proposal also contains a previously unseen demand among Catalan parties, which have traditionally been pro-European: a debate and a decision \u201con membership of the European Union, the monetary and economic union, NATO and other international organizations.\u201d\nThe pro-independence majority in parliament also asked for an amnesty law if the Supreme Court should find the secessionist leaders guilty of rebellion. Ciudadanos, the Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the Popular Party (PP) voted against, while Catalunya en Com\u00fa Podem, the Catalan branch of Podemos, abstained.\nSeparatist lawmakers additionally demanded that the Civil Guard law enforcement agency be pulled out of Catalonia entirely.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/27/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
