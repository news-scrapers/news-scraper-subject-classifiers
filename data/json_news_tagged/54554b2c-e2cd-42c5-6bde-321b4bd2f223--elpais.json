These leaders face charges ranging from misuse of public funds to rebellion, which could entail long prison terms.\nThe separatist movement has also been galvanized by last week\u2019s police raid against members of the grassroots pro-independence group Committees to Defend the Republic (CDR), seven of whom were sent to prison without bail on terrorism charges after they were allegedly found in possession of bomb-making material. Two have since confessed to making and testing explosives, according to the investigation.\nPro-independence citizens are rallying around a new group that calls itself Democratic Tsunami and has no visible leaders. Separatist parties have welcomed the initiative. The webpage of Democratic Tsunami is registered with a Caribbean-based company named Njalla that boasts about \u201cacting as a privacy shield,\u201d and which was also used to host the website listing the voter census for the independence referendum.\nCivil society groups are considering \u201cblocking off roads\u201d to protest the Supreme Court\u2019s upcoming ruling. David Fern\u00e1ndez, a national secretary for ANC, said that \u201cseveral collectives\u201d are talking about a three-day march to Barcelona that would take them through Catalonia\u2019s main arteries.\n\u201cIt would be a 100-kilometer march, covering 20 kilometers every half a day and blocking the main road network,\u201d he said in statements to the Catalan TV station BTV.\nMeanwhile, the separatist parties Together for Catalonia (JxCAT), Catalan Republican Left (ERC) and the anti-capitalist party CUP, together with the civil society organizations Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and \u00d2mnium, are planning a joint event in Barcelona on Tuesday to unveil \u201ca unitary framework for mobilization\u201d in response to the Supreme Court decision.\nSo far, the separatist movement\u2019s actions are reminiscent of the preparations for the 2017 independence referendum, which was held despite having been declared illegal by the Constitutional Court.\nQuim Torra, a separatist who became the Catalan premier in May 2018, has said that he will only accept the Supreme Court\u2019s decision if the defendants are acquitted. But disagreements within his own Cabinet have made it difficult to come up with a unified response, most recently over the possibility of a strike on October 11.\nOn the legal front, Catalonia\u2019s three separatist parties recently passed several motions in the regional parliament demanding amnesty for the tried leaders if they should be found guilty of rebellion.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/01/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
