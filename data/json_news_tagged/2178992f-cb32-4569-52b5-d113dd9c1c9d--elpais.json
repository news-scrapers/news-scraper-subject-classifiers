He was killed in ISIS\u2019 self-proclaimed caliphate. The latter woman has three children who hold Spanish nationality.\nThe Spanish government has been analyzing the case since April, when this newspaper revealed their presence\nThe four \u2013 who have a total of 17 children under their care, including a newborn \u2013 are wanted by several Spanish courts for \u201cterrorism-related crimes,\u201d according to police sources.\nThe alleged jihadists \u2013 Luna Fern\u00e1ndez, Yolanda Mart\u00ednez, Lubna Mohamed Miludi and Loubna Fares \u2013 are being held in camps for relatives of ISIS fighters. Fern\u00e1ndez and Mart\u00ednez are at Al Roj camp, in northern Syria, near the border with Turkey. Miludi and Fares remain in Al Hol, the camp in northeast Syria that all four were taken to after the fall of Baghouz, the last ISIS redoubt, in February.\nThe Spanish government has been analyzing the case since April, when EL PA\u00cdS revealed their presence at the Syrian camps, where living conditions have been described as extremely unsanitary and dangerous. A committee of officials from the Foreign, Interior and Justice ministries are reviewing the case and considering repatriation options, in line with similar action by other European Union countries such as France or Germany.\nAt least two of the four women \u2013 Luna Fern\u00e1ndez and Yolanda Mart\u00ednez, who converted to Islam \u2013 are classified as \u201cdangerous\u201d in police records\nThere are security concerns on the table as well: at least two of the four women \u2013 Luna Fern\u00e1ndez and Yolanda Mart\u00ednez, who converted to Islam \u2013 are classified as \u201cdangerous\u201d in police records.\nIf they returned to Spain, they would be immediately arrested and probably held in preventive custody. They could face charges of collaborating with, or being members of, a terrorist organization, a crime that entails prison terms of six to 12 years.\nWhile the executive studies the case, several investigating courts have issued arrest warrants against all four women. Spain has no extradition agreement with Syria, which has been at war for eight-and-a-half years. It does have a business attach\u00e9 in Beirut who periodically visits the capital city Damascus.\nLegal sources said that the government is proceeding very cautiously as the case has criminal, security and even humanitarian implications, given the presence of minors. In May, the NGO Doctors Without Borders reported that 8,000 women and more than 3,000 children inside the Al Hol camp have no access to medical care.\nThe investigation is dragging out in Spain, which still has an acting government following the inconclusive April 28 election\nIn April, prosecutors at the High Court asked the Interior Ministry for a report on the Spanish women, who were asking to go back to Spain with their own children as well as the ones they are caring for. They all claim that they followed their husbands to the conflict zone without realizing what they were getting into. Counter-terrorism sources noted that at least two of them, Yolanda Mart\u00ednez and Luna Fern\u00e1ndez, show up in earlier High Court investigations into a jihadist cell known as the Al Andalus brigade.\nThe investigation is dragging out in Spain, which still has an acting government following the inconclusive April 28 election. By contrast, Germany and France have been moving more rapidly, the former having brought four children back from Syria in mid-August, with the latter having already repatriated a dozen orphans.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/05/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
