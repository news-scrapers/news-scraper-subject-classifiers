According to another resident, the Civil Guard ordered people to leave their homes at 4am on Sunday, and \u201cwoke up elderly people, some with severe mobility issues, so they would go.\u201d\nAlthough a control line has been created around the fire, the national weather service is forecasting winds that could gust up to 70 km/h on Monday evening. Around 230 firefighters will remain stationed in the area to try to prevent the flames from jumping the barrier and spreading further.\nThe wildfire broke out around noon on Saturday in Artenara, a hamlet of 1,000 residents located in the northwest portion of the island. Two more municipalities, Tejeda (1,921 residents) and G\u00e1ldar (24,000) have also been affected by the flames. A total of 1,000 hectares of land have been burnt, according to the latest reports.\nA 55-year-old man who had been working in the area with a welding machine has been arrested by the Civil Guard, who suspect that he accidentally started the fire in a property near Cruce de las Pe\u00f1as.\n\nJos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel, who owns a farm 200 meters away from Cruce de las Pe\u00f1as, was evacuated to the municipality Acusa Seca, where \u201cthe smoke made it difficult to breathe.\u201d He described the fire as a \u201cdisaster, more than my trees and my farm, it pains me to see so many burned pine trees.\u201d\nEmergency workers now fear that the wind could push the flames towards Aldea de San Nicol\u00e1s and La Degollada de Tejeda, although no new evacuations have been ordered for now.\nCrews are working within a 23-kilometer perimeter, digging ditches and applying water to create control lines that will keep the fire within the established boundaries.\n\u201cThe fire is contained, but has not been put out and could develop further,\u201d said Torres, who thanked the 500 to 600 individuals working since Saturday to snuff out the blaze. Ten helicopters and an airplane are being used in the effort.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/12/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
