The innocent pursuit of the coveted goods by four Spanish Civil Protection volunteers has led to the suspension of four border control agents, and also to an internal investigation by the Gibraltarian authorities due to what is being perceived as a serious security oversight.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sparked a terrible fuss,\u201d says Jes\u00fas Narv\u00e1ez, chief of the Civil Protection Unit who was driving his colleagues in an official vehicle into \u201cThe Rock,\u201d as the British Overseas Territory, located off the south of Spain, is commonly known.\nWe crossed right under their noses and they didn\u2019t say anything\nJes\u00fas Narv\u00e1ez, chief of the Civil Protection Unit\nAll from the small M\u00e1laga town of El Burgo, the four volunteers had been collaborating in a security exercise in Manilva, and, being in the vicinity, decided to cross into Gibraltar for some shopping and a bit of sightseeing. \u201cWe asked our mayor for permission and he told us to go for it,\u201d says Narv\u00e1ez.\nThe harmless expedition turned into a security alert for Gibraltar\u2019s authorities as not one of the border control guards realized Spaniards cannot enter the British territory in Civil Protection uniform driving an official vehicle without proper permission. \u201cIf they had refused us entry, we would have turned around,\u201d says Narva\u00e9z, who is now urging the mayor of El Burgo to resign for giving them the green light in the first place. \u201cI asked if we could cross and they said yes. We crossed right under their noses and they didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\nHalf-an-hour into their tour of Gibraltar, Narv\u00e1ez became aware something was amiss. \u201cWe realized that people were filming us,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was as if we were terrorists. Then we realized that they thought we were Spanish police. It created a stir.\u201d\nThe tour, which had aimed to take in Gibraltar\u2019s famous monkeys, was cut short when Narv\u00e1ez\u2019s three colleagues entered a supermarket for the cheese and chocolate. Inside the store, the trio were approached by the Royal Gibraltar Police who escorted them to the police station. \u201cWe were interrogated but treated well,\u201d says Narv\u00e1ez who has been a volunteer with his local Civil Protection force for 10 years. \u201cOne of them even said, \u2018Look what you\u2019ve done to my Sunday!\u2019\u201d\nThe Gibraltar police officers then accompanied the volunteers back to the border. However, once off The Rock, they decided they needed to get back. \u201cAfter all the fuss, we weren\u2019t going to leave without the shopping,\u201d says Narv\u00e1ez. \u201cMy colleagues changed their clothes and went back in.\u201d\nIt was as if we were terrorists\nJes\u00fas Narv\u00e1ez\nJust hours after the incident, footage of officers taking the four Spaniards down to the police station went viral on social networks. \u201cI am asking all relevant bodies to explain to me how on Earth this has happened and to ensure it does not happen again,\u201d tweeted Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar\u2019s Chief Minister.\nPicardo\u2019s unease over the incident has turned it into a disciplinary matter that will be dealt with internally, according to a Government statement. Meanwhile, two HM Customs officials and two members of the Borders and Coastguard Agency have been suspended.\nOn the other side of the border, Narv\u00e1ez is being kept busy fielding questions from the media. \u201cI totally understand their indignation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s another country and it\u2019s a border. Something\u2019s not working.\u201d\nSome of the insulting comments on social media, however, have come as an unwelcome surprise. \u201cWe get a better response offering help as disinterested volunteers,\u201d he says.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/30/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
