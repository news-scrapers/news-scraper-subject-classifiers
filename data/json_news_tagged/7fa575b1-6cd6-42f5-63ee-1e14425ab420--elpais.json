The Spanish airport authority, Aena, said that flights were cancelled after crews were unable to reach their aircraft. And by 5pm, passengers trying to travel to the city center found themselves waiting in long lines for buses and taxis that were being obstructed by enormous crowds of protesters.\nAt around 6pm, the police were instructed to clear the area to prevent demonstrators from \u201cviolently accessing\u201d the inside of the airport, according to Mossos d\u2019Esquadra sources. Foam bullets were used against the crowd, and emergency services reported treating 56 people, 10 of whom were taken to the hospital. Some protesters hurled objects at the police while others sat down on the pavement. Vueling, Iberia and Air Europa were among the airlines that cancelled flights.\nThe occupation of the area around the airport was organized by Democratic Tsunami, a grassroots movement with no visible leaders that uses social media to mobilize followers and is looking to the Hong Kong protests for inspiration. The group distributed fake boarding passes and called on demonstrators to use any means possible to get to the airport, even on foot.\nUnlike the well-organized airport occupation, street protests in downtown Barcelona were more spontaneous and erratic. When the Supreme Court ruling became known on Monday morning, there were small demonstrations made up mostly of students, retirees and Catalan government workers. Around 50 people blocked the intersection of Gran Via and Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, and small scattered groups gathered in other parts of the city center while the police looked on and rerouted traffic.\nThe protests gained momentum after noon, when around 25,000 people, according to the local police, gathered at Catalunya square. Then, at 1pm, Democratic Tsunami issued its call for followers to descend on El Prat airport. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a Hong Kong!\u201d yelled a youth as the square quickly emptied out.\nOn Monday night, thousands more marched in downtown Barcelona to protest the Supreme Court ruling. Independence leaders had said that they would only accept a full acquittal for the 12 individuals on trial over their role in the failed breakaway bid.\nDuring protests in Tarragona on Monday, a woman bearing a Spanish flag who was confronting supporters of secession was punched in the face. The woman was waving her flag and shouting at demonstrators that they were on \u201cSpanish soil.\u201d At one point, one of the protesters snatched her flag away. She responded by grabbing the man\u2019s backpack, and he spun around and struck her hard in the face. Many of the protesters came to the woman\u2019s aid, while she continued to shout: \u201cYou are murderers.\u201d Two police officers assisted her and took her away from the scene. The man was arrested by the National Police on Tuesday for charges including assault. Far-right political party Vox announced on Monday that it would file a police complaint over the incident, given that the woman is a member of the group.\nActing Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said on Tuesday that there would be an investigation into who is behind Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic, the grassroots group with no visible leaders that organized the protests yesterday at Barcelona\u2019s El Prat airport.\n\u201cOf course there are investigations, we have efficient intelligence services and we will end up knowing who is behind these actions by Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic,\u201d the interior chief said.\nGrande-Marlaska, of the Socialist Party (PSOE), also echoed the acting prime minister\u2019s statement on Monday that there would be no government pardons for the convicted Catalan independence leaders.\n\u00a0English version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/15/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
