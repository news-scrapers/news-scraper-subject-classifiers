Since August, the outbreak has killed three people, caused seven miscarriages, and infected more than 200 people. The source of the bacterial infection was traced to a Seville-based company called Magrudis, which sold a contaminated pork loin product called carne mechada under the brand name La Mech\u00e1. Three more products produced by the company also tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes.\nThe owners of Magrudis, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mar\u00edn Pince and his two children Sandro and Mario, have been accused, to different degrees, of involuntary manslaughter, crimes against health and causing injury to a fetus. Listeria is a bacterial infection that can cause severe illnesses such as sepsis, meningitis and encephalitis. In a healthy person, the symptoms are minor but for unborn babies and people whose immune systems are compromised the infection can be fatal.\nThe outbreak has killed three people, led to seven abortions, and affected more than 200 people\nAccording to investigators, the three men knew in February that some of their products had been contaminated but did nothing to eliminate the bacteria from their facilities. Instead they continued producing and distributing their products.\n\u201cWhen the crisis broke, we reminded the business by email that one of their samples had been contaminated much earlier. Given that they did nothing, we passed on this information to the courts,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Antonio Borr\u00e1s, the owner of the Microal Group laboratory, told EL PA\u00cdS.\nThe laboratory handed a report to the court in early September, and according to sources close to the investigation, the contents prompted Judge Pilar Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, who is overseeing the case, to take action on Tuesday.\nNeither laboratories nor companies are legally obliged to warn the authorities if a product is found to test positive, but a company does have a duty to adopt measures to correct the problem. Investigators want to find out why the owners of Magrudis did not do this, and why, more importantly they hid the positive test results from health inspectors who visited the factory after the alert was raised. In public appearances, both Mar\u00edn and his son Sandro claimed that the company had successfully passed all sanitary controls.\nTraces of listeria were found in tests carried out on the Magrudis production line, including the oven carts used to transport the meat during the preparation process, and the larding needles used to inject the pork with fat before cooking. The crisis was complicated by the fact that the company\u2019s products had been sold on to another firm and prepared for sale as an own-brand product in a supermarket chain without the proper labeling.\nIn the case against the owners, Judge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez has named the \u201ctrue administrator\u201d of Magrudis as Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mar\u00edn Ponce. But it is his son, Sandro Mar\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez, who is listed on Spain\u2019s business register as the owner and administrator of the company. But when Magrudis was created in August 2013, he was just a university student thinking about dropping out of a pharmacy degree. \u201cThe company isn\u2019t his, it\u2019s his father\u2019s, it always has been. The son perhaps helps him now, but I had never even seen him until he appeared on television the other day,\u201d explained one client, who wished to remain anonymous.\nThe father, Mar\u00edn, has three failed businesses behind him. In 1993, he had a stake in the meat-trading company Sanmasue, which declared bankruptcy at the end of the decade. In 1996, Mar\u00edn Ponce founded a meat-retail business called Sierra Encina, which also had a short life. The business \u2013 which has a woman, presumably his wife, listed as the administrator \u2013 had unpaid loans in 2001 and 2003, according to the commercial register bulletin (Borme). And in 2000, he created Embutidos El Patio, which declared insolvency in 2012.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/25/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
