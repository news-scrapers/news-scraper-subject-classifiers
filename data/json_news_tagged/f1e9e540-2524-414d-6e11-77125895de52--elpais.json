He reportedly even drove to Madrid on his Vespa scooter to sell his vision to the dictator, Francisco Franco, which included allowing topless bathing for the northern European sun-seekers.\n\u201cThe Benidorm model was totally cutting-edge because it was a model for the whole city, with a vision for the future, something that was unusual at that time,\u201d says the architect Jos\u00e9 Manuel Escobedo, a member of the city\u2019s Urban Landscape Council who works out of the JAS studio. \u201cMore appreciated, as often happens, outside Spain than within.\u201d\nEscobedo uses a packet of cigarettes to illustrate the thinking behind the decision to grow upwards \u2013 if you lay it down on its biggest surface area, you have a model of construction that is no different to anywhere else, but if you balance it on its smallest surface area, you have skyscrapers that allow for land to be kept free for green zones, parking and pools. \u201cAlthough it is compared to Manhattan, there is only one skyscraper here for every four there,\u201d says Escobedo, adding that it is a more egalitarian resort than most. \u201cPreviously, the wealthiest occupied the beachfront properties, but here you can see the sea from every building.\u201d\nWriting in the collection of essays Trial and Error in Benidorm, the architects Carlos Ferrater and Xavier Mart\u00ed, who won the 2011 National Architecture Award for the promenade along Poniente beach in Benidorm, say, \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the Benidorm model has been one of the most sustainable along the Spanish Mediterranean coast on account of the small land area used \u2013 just a few hectares \u2013 and the very reduced use of private transportation due to the fact that anywhere in the city you are within 10 minutes walking distance from the beach.\u201d\nAlthough it might seem quite the opposite at first glance, the collection of skyscrapers in Benidorm is more ecological than other typical tourist resorts along the Mediterranean, such as the sprawling developments complete with golf courses, which use up a lot more land and energy and require more roads and means of transportation. Besides, Benidorm manages to attract tourists all year round, which means the resources and land are made full use of. While the city occupies just 1% of the Mediterranean coast in the Valencia region, it accounts for a large proportion of its tourists.\n\u201cIt seems like a very open urban plan, but it is in fact very limited,\u201d says Alejandro Mu\u00f1oz, from the Interproyectos studio and also a member of the Urban Landscape Council. \u201cFor example, the buildings can\u2019t be too close together and the fronts can\u2019t be more than 50 meters [across]. You can always have a view of the beach. It seems very built up, but there are no closed blocks such as exist in big cities. Garden areas have been protected and there is still space to expand in the future.\u201d\nMu\u00f1oz goes on to say that the collection of needle-like buildings and their landmark elevation affords the city a very distinctive global image, explaining its application for recognition as a Unesco world heritage site, he adds, \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else like it.\u201d\nThe highest of Benidorm\u2019s skyscrapers is Intempo, a P\u00e9rez-Guerras Architects & Engineers project, launched in 2006. It looks like a massive letter M with gold fa\u00e7ades, and it rises above the rest of the city in the southwest corner, standing 192 meters tall, over 47 floors. The building has never been inhabited, however, as the collapse of the real estate sector reduced it to a white elephant and for years it stood as no more than a reminder of the Spanish property debacle.\nNow, with new owners, the project has been revived and the apartments will be placed on the market, with prices expected to be in the range of \u20ac1 million for property on the top floors and in the central area that joins the two towers.\nThe Gran Hotel Bali is the second-highest building in Benidorm. It stands 186 meters tall, split into 52 floors. The hotel is the work of the late architect Antonio Escario and it opened in 2002. It is a symmetrical and svelte building with a base that gradually tapers off as it rises. As Escario told EL PA\u00cdS at the time of its inauguration, \u201cThe size of the building is no mystery. To build it up, we used what is known in the profession as common sense.\u201d\nDue to its height, which trumped the Picasso Tower in Madrid, various events have been held there, such as an annual stair-climbing race and a base-jumping championship.\nThe third highest is the L\u00fagano Tower, which rises 158 meters and has 43 floors. The work of Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez, it may not be the tallest building per se but it is the highest feature of the Benidorm skyline, standing as it does 287 meters above sea level at the end of Levante beach in the area known as Rinc\u00f3n de Loix.\nFourth in terms of elevation is the Neguri Gane, reaching 145 meters over 43 floors. Designed by architects Roberto P\u00e9rez-Guerras and Julio P\u00e9rez Gegundez, it was inaugurated in 2002 with curves reminiscent of the \u2018brutalist\u2019 style of architecture evident in S\u00e1enz de Oiza\u2019s Torres Blancas in Madrid.\nComing in fifth is the Kronos building at 140 meters over 41 floors. Located on Levante beach near to Neguri Gane, it was designed by MAPRC.\nThe city of Benidorm has been praised for its uniqueness and vilified for its crowded streets and beaches. \u201cOnly from the viewpoint of a culture that has turned exclusivity and individual choice into consensual slogans can the disdain for Benidorm be understood in cultural terms,\u201d says town planner Iago Carro.\nMeanwhile, Mu\u00f1oz, maintains that much of the criticism reserved for Benidorm is unjustified. \u201cBut people are gradually understanding it better,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just the opposite of what most people believe it to be and of the way it is portrayed by the media.\u201d\nRight now, Benidorm\u2019s skyscrapers and its intense and multi-faceted lifestyle seem to be fashionable again. But not all its buildings are iconic and there is plenty of functional and poor quality construction. \u201cWhat the city is lacking is for all the buildings to aspire to this benchmark; for the same investment, you can have a more dignified and interesting architecture,\u201d says Escobedo. \u201cYou just need to work with the same budget but with more love.\u201d\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/19/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
