After stating that change cannot be forced from the outside, in allusion to US pressure for regime change, the king insisted that \u201chuman rights are best defended in a democracy.\u201d\nThe speech \u2013 the most important of Felipe VI\u2019s state visit to Cuba \u2013 was made during an official dinner at the Captains General Palace in Havana. The Spanish royals put on the event for Cuban authorities after D\u00edaz-Canal invited them to dine at the headquarters of the Council of State on Tuesday. During his talk, Felipe VI underscored the need for institutions to \u201crepresent the diverse and plural reality\u201d of society, and to respect the rights of citizens, including the right \u201cto freely express their ideas, freedom of association and assembly.\u201d\nD\u00edaz-Canel promised Spanish businesses a \u201crelevant participation\u201d in Cuba\u2019s development plans until 2030\nThe king used the 1978 Spanish Constitution as a model, arguing it was \u201cbased on agreement, negotiation, consensus and reconciliation,\u201d and said it had allowed Spain to see its \u201cbest years as a fully democratic country.\u201d\n\u201cFrom this Constitution and from our very history, Spaniards have learned that human rights, freedom and the dignity of people and the interests of our citizens are best represented and defended in a democracy,\u201d he added.\nAlthough the Cuban president was not expected to make any speeches at the event, and did not speak at the dinner on Tuesday, he decided to respond to Felipe VI\u2019s plea. In his reply, D\u00edaz-Canel defended the sovereignty and independence of Cubans to decide the rhythm and reach of its own changes. \u201cOn this path that we have willingly chosen, it is important to count on the accompaniment of your true friends in the world, and the Spaniards are among them,\u201d he said.\nThe words of both heads of state were carefully chosen to ensure there was no disagreement. The king used the verb \u201caccompany\u201d to describe Spain\u2019s support for the transformation Cuba is undergoing, \u201cin respect\u201d of Cuba\u2019s own decisions. But while Felipe VI spoke about political changes towards a democratic, pluralistic regime that respects basic rights, the Cuban president appeared to focus solely on economic reforms.\nSources from the Spanish government admitted that the king could not visit Cuba without making a call in favor of democracy, and that this plea went as far as what Cuban authorities were willing to allow. D\u00edaz-Canel did not seem upset by the king\u2019s speech. Indeed, he applauded Felipe VI and thanked him for Spain\u2019s \u201cclear and public support\u201d against the \u201cunfair\u201d US sanctions that \u201ccause so much hurt\u201d to the Cuban people. D\u00edaz-Canel also commended the \u201cloyalty and commitment\u201d of Spanish businesses, threatened by US sanctions, and he promised the latter a \u201crelevant participation\u201d in Cuba\u2019s development plans until 2030.\nSpaniards have learned that human rights, freedom and the dignity of people and the interests of our citizens are best represented and defended in a democracy\nKing Felipe VI\nBefore the dinner, King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia met with 22 representatives of Cuban civil society, including entrepreneurs, owners of private businesses, journalists from independent digital media groups, as well as writers and artists like Jorge Perugorr\u00eda and Leonardo Paduro.\nAccording to several people who attended the meeting, the king promised them that Spain would support their independent business and cultural initiatives, and asked them if they thought the current economic reforms were irreversible. The guests thanked the Spanish royals for their visit, and asked them to call on Spain to strengthen its relations with Cuba and boost the visibility of its civil society.\nKing Felipe VI and Queen Leticia arrived in Havana on Monday for a state visit aimed at sealing the full normalization of historically complex relations between both countries. This trip marks the first time a Spanish monarch has made an official visit to the island in 500 years.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/14/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
