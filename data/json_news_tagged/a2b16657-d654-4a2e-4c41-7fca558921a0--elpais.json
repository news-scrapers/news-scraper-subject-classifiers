Protests were also staged in Barcelona on Monday during a visit by the Spanish royal family to the Catalan capital for an award ceremony.\nSources familiar with the operation said that up to 2,500 officers of the National Police and 2,000 members of the Civil Guard will patrol the streets to impede any acts of violence on election day.\nOfficial sources at the Spanish Interior Ministry reduced the overall figure to around 3,000. But sources at the Barcelona-based Security Coordination Center (CECOR), where all three police agencies are represented, have confirmed it will be closer to 4,500.\nAnother 8,000 members of the regional police force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, will secure polling stations across the northeastern region. Sources at the Catalan law-enforcement agency said that patrol officers will be stationed at each polling station in municipalities with a population of over 4,000, stretching the force\u2019s operational capability to the limit.\nThe decision to send reinforcements to the region comes after the recent episode of week-long street clashes between violent independence activists and riot police. Around 600 people were injured, 200 protesters were arrested, and 28 placed in custody. Barcelona authorities have estimated the damage at over \u20ac2.5 million.\nOfficers have also been asked to be operational on Saturday, the \u201cday of reflection\u201d that precedes election day according to Spanish legislation. A leaderless, social-media based separatist group that calls itself Democratic Tsunami \u2013 already under investigation by the Spanish courts for its alleged role in the street disturbances \u2013 has urged sympathizers to participate in activities aimed at \u201cdisobeying the Electoral Board.\u201d These include a demonstration in downtown Barcelona at 4pm on Saturday. Democratic Tsunami has also defended \u201cthe exercise of the right to vote\u201d and stated that it will not seek to hinder voting on election day.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/06/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
