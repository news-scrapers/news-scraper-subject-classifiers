Around 400 BC, they were sent packing by the Iberians, who in turn were swept aside by the Romans; and they, by the Visigoths. But instead of destroying the evidence of the culture that preceded them, each of these distinct peoples simply built on top of it.\nThe gallery became a popular place to keep sheep in recent times\nAs a result, as experts point out, this eight-hectare archeological site known as La Cava is \u201ca series of time capsules.\u201d When archeologists opened it, they found the largest Iberian building known to date, complete with three rooms more than three meters high.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it that we know of, but we\u2019re still investigating,\u201d says Miguel \u00c1ngel Valero, professor of ancient history at the University of Castilla-La Mancha. \u201cWhat we usually find in these kinds of digs are the remains of walls made of stone or adobe, which every now and again rise above a meter high.\u201d\nMar Juzgado, an archeologist on Valero\u2019s team, adds, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we are going to find at this site, because there is nothing similar to compare it with.\u201d\nAt the start of this decade, the mayor of Garcinarro at the time, Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez Odene, was convinced there was an archeological treasure to be found on the outskirts of town, and he badgered the authorities about it. His words fell on deaf ears, however, until Valero noticed something odd on the archeological map \u2013 a secret document signaling possible digs in an area. Archeologists started working here in 2014, and Valero was rewarded with evidence of a mishmash of cultures that had settled strategically at a central spot for north-south communications in the peninsula, up on a cliff more than 60 meters high.\nBesides a \u201cunique building\u201d that measures 70 square meters, the complex includes the remains of a Bronze Age settlement, a rampart from that period whose height is yet to be established, and an area covered with hundreds of small holes on a rocky surface, which could have been made for decorative or spiritual purposes. There is also a 70-meter long gallery, which is seven meters deep, dug out of the rock by the pre-Roman settlers, and dozens of coves, which would have been occupied by hermits during the Visigoth era.\nWhile the archeologists are still unable to establish the use of the unique building itself, there are a number of theories, one of which is that it served as a temple; another, that it was a space for storage and product handling.\nOne of the building\u2019s three rooms is itself divided into two areas. The middle room is accessed by a door made from rock that would have had a lintel, while its southern wall had a large recess more than a meter high. It is possible that the lintel was punctuated by holes to allow the sun rays to shine on the alcove, where the Iberians may have placed a divinity figure.\nWhat is surprising is that the sun would only touch this point at the end of the month of August \u2013 some time away from the summer and winter solstices, which would set it apart from all other known sundials. \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery because the end of August does not coincide with any agricultural season,\u201d says Valero. \u201cWhy would they want to mark this date?\u201d\nIt is possible that some kind of earthquake led to the lintel falling over the cliff that protects the building on the north side, but the archeologists are confident they will find it. The rooms are lined with wall recesses and basins, and on the floors it is still possible to detect evidence of hearths and even the imprints of tables. Archeologists have also come across ceramics, brooches and tools such as hammers and picks from the Iberian era, fragments of terra sigillata tableware from the Roman era, and metal pieces from the Visigoths.\nThe archeological treasures from all these periods have survived thanks to the use that shepherds made of the site for their sheep. The mysterious 70-meter gallery, for example, was a decent place to keep dozens of animals. And these animals, with their waste, helped to conserve the remains that the Iberians, Romans and Visigoths had left over a period of 25 centuries.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\nGarcinarro is a hamlet of 121 inhabitants in a region of Spain known historically as the Alcarria. The former mayor, Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez, tried everything to get rural tourism off the ground. So it was only natural that he would focus on the archeological site and add a bit of color of his own.\nHence, visitors have been welcomed by Vikings, Celts and knights while medieval music played in the background.\n\u201cI have already said that it\u2019s got nothing to do with it, and we are not going to join in,\u201d says professor Valero. \u201cBut he\u2019s doing what he can for the local economy. I can understand that.\u201d\nFern\u00e1ndez even managed to get the town on a TV show with a rock that looks like a serpent and has claims of being the mythical god Thor. A small quarry has also been dubbed a sacrificial altar, complete with red paint to look like blood.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t harm anyone,\u201d adds Valero with a shrug. \u201cThey even look after the site, but it\u2019s a leap from there to whether any of it is true.\u201d\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/01/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
