The scientists then injected human stem cells, which are capable of creating any type of tissue, into the embryo. The product of this work is a monkey with human cells that has not been born, because researchers stopped the process.\n\u201cThe results are very promising,\u201d says N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a biologist and vice chancellor of research at UCAM. The team has not provided more details because they are waiting to publish their findings in an internationally renowned scientific journal. \u201cFrom UCAM and the Salk Institute we are now trying not only to move forward and continue experimenting with human cells and rodent and pig cells, but also with non-human primates,\u201d explains Izpis\u00faa. \u201cOur country is a pioneer and a world leader in these investigations,\u201d he adds.\nIzpis\u00faa, born in Hell\u00edn (Albacete) in 1960, says that in 2017 his team conducted \u201cthe first experiment of human and pig chimeras in the world,\u201d although with less success. \u201cThe human cells did not take hold. We saw that they contributed very little [to the development of the embryo]: one human cell for ever 100,000 pig cells,\u201d says the Argentinean veterinarian Pablo Ross, a researcher from the University of California at Davis and a co-author of that experiment.\nThe results are very promising\nBiologist Estrella N\u00fa\u00f1ez\nIzpis\u00faa\u2019s team has been able to create chimeras between more similar species, for instance the rat and the mouse, which is five times closer than humans and pigs. In 2017, the researchers also used the revolutionary genome editing tool CRISPR to deactivate genes in mouse embryos that are fundamental to the development of the heart, eyes and pancreas. The team then introduced rat stem cells that were capable of generating these organs. The result was a series of rat-mouse chimera embryos, whose gestation was also stopped in accordance to the international consensus regarding these types of experiments.\nDoctor \u00c1ngel Raya, the director of the Barcelona Regenerative Medicine Center, explains that experiments with chimeras face \u201cethical barriers.\u201d \u201cWhat happens if the stem cells escape and form human neurons in the brain of the animal? Would it have consciousness? And what happens if these stem cells turn into sperm cells?\u201d he asks. N\u00fa\u00f1ez assures that Izpisu\u00e1\u2019s research team has created mechanisms \u201cso that if human cells migrate to the brain, they will self-destruct.\u201d\nThe name comes from Greek mythology, which described monstrous creatures that were part dragon, part goat, part lion. Today's chimeras are organisms that contain cells from two different species.\nTo avoid ethical issues, the scientific community has traditionally set the \u201cred line at 14 days\u201d of gestation, says Raya, which is not enough time for the embryo to develop a human central nervous system. All chimera embryos are destroyed before that period expires. \u201cIn no case is the gestation brought to full term,\u201d adds N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\nIzpis\u00faa\u2019s research with monkeys in China was financed in large part by the UCAM, and did not come cheap. \u201cIf we combine the human/pig, human/rat and human/monkey research, it is many hundreds of thousands of euros,\u201d says N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\nIn Spain, this type of research is heavily restricted and limited only to investigation into deadly diseases. \u201cWe are doing the experiments with monkeys in China because, in principle, they cannot be done here because of lack of infrastructure,\u201d explains the vice chancellor, who plays down the fact that her university is Catholic. \u201cWhat we want is to make progress for the sake of people who have a disease,\u201d she adds. N\u00fa\u00f1ez underlines that the Spanish ethical committees approved the experiment of human and pig chimeras in Murcia in 2017.\n\u201cThe ultimate goal would be to create a human organ that could be transplanted, but the path itself is almost more interesting for today\u2019s scientists,\u201d says N\u00fa\u00f1ez. \u201cI am essentially aware that I will not see it happen [the development of human organs in animals] but to arrive at that point, it\u2019s necessary to pass through this one.\u201d\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "07/31/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
