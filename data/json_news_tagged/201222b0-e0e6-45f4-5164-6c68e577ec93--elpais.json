But politically, most of these combinations are highly unlikely.\n\u201cVery soon we will be in a position to make an offer of dialogue,\u201d said Carmen Calvo, the deputy prime minister in the caretaker administration of Pedro S\u00e1nchez, on the radio station Cadena SER on Monday.\nBut there seems to be no easy options in a fractured parliament where the next prime minister will first need to secure endorsement for his new government at an investiture vote to be held in the coming weeks.\nPossible majorities\nAbsolute\nmajority\n176\nTotal seats\n158\n180\n170\n208\n100\n152\n218\n170\nPSOE + UP + MP\t\nPSOE + UP + MP + PNV + BNG +\nCC + PRC + Cs + TE\nPSOE + UP + MP + PNV + BNG +\nCC + PRC + TE\nPSOE + PP\nCiudadanos + NA+ + PP\nCiudadanos + NA+ + PP + Vox\nPSOE + Cs + PP (Abstenci\u00f3n)\nPSOE + UP + MP + PNV + BNG +\nCC + PRC + TE\nPossible majorities\nTotal seats\nAbsolute\nmajority\n176\n158\n180\n170\n208\n100\n152\n218\n170\nPSOE + UP + MP\t\nPSOE + UP + MP + PNV + BNG +\nCC + PRC + Cs + TE\nPSOE + UP + MP + PNV + BNG +\nCC + PRC + TE\nPSOE + PP\nCiudadanos + NA+ + PP\nCiudadanos + NA+ + PP + Vox\nPSOE + Cs + PP (Abstenci\u00f3n)\nPSOE + UP + MP + PNV + BNG +\nCC + PRC + TE\nPossible majorities\nAbsolute majority\n176\nTotal seats\n158\n180\n170\n208\n100\n152\n218\n170\nPSOE + UP + MP\t\nPSOE + UP + MP + PNV + BNG +\nCC + PRC + Cs + TE\nPSOE + UP + MP + PNV + BNG +\nCC + PRC + TE\nPSOE + PP\nCiudadanos + NA+ + PP\nCiudadanos + NA+ + PP + Vox\nPSOE + Cs + PP (Abstenci\u00f3n)\nPSOE + UP + MP + PNV + BNG +\nCC + PRC + TE\nSource: Ministerio del Interior\n EL PA\u00cdS\nThe easiest option in terms of the math would be a combination of the PSOE and the Popular Party (PP), which improved on its dismal results of April 28 to win 88 seats on Sunday. But this scenario, which would yield well in excess of the 176 seats required for an absolute majority, seems highly improbable. On Monday, the PSOE\u2019s organization secretary, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, rejected the notion.\n\u201cWe are not going to bank on a grand coalition with a political right that does not accept its share of responsibility,\u201d he said after a meeting of the PSOE executive committee.\nVery soon we will be in a position to make an offer of dialogue\nCaretaker Deputy PM Carmen Calvo\nSome voices within the PP, however, seem to favor at least allowing the PSOE to form a government by abstaining at the investiture vote. \u201cI hope that all political forces will exercise utmost responsibility and not exclude any options on the table,\u201d said M\u00e1laga mayor Francisco de la Torre, adding that \u201cthe PP could abstain in order to quickly facilitate a PSOE government.\u201d\nIf the center-right Ciudadanos\u2019 10 representatives backed a PSOE government and the PP\u2019s 88 lawmakers abstained, it would produce 130 affirmative votes, and S\u00e1nchez would then need just three more endorsements from small regional parties to get himself returned to office in the second round of the investiture vote, which only requires more yes than no votes (the first round requires 176).\nBut the PSOE is not hopeful about this scenario. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect a PP abstention; their margin is very small and it looks like they won\u2019t do it due to pressure from the far right,\u201d said \u00c1balos.\nOn Monday, Miquel Iceta, the head of the Catalan Socialist Party (PSC), warned other parties against blocking a PSOE administration. \u201cWhoever votes no to Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s proposal will be voting with Vox,\u201d he said.\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s failure to secure enough support after the April 28 election led to the repeat vote on Sunday. Turnout was 69.9%, down from 75.5% in April, reflecting voter apathy and frustration at politicians\u2019 inability or unwillingness to strike deals.\n\u00c1balos said on Monday that \u201cour commitment is to make sure there isn\u2019t a third election, but a progressive government.\u201d\nIn order to get himself back into office without relying on the PP, S\u00e1nchez could attempt to secure support from the leftist Unidas Podemos (UP, 35 seats), from its offshoot M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds (MP, two seats), from Ciudadanos \u2013 which suffered a stinging defeat on Sunday, losing 47 seats out of the 57 it won in April \u2013 and from various regional parties from the Basque Country, (PNV) Canary Islands (CC), Teruel (TE), Cantabria (PRC) and Galicia (BNG).\nSuch an endorsement would save S\u00e1nchez the trouble of having to ask the Catalan Republican Left (ERC), a separatist party with 13 representatives in Congress, to support him or at the very least abstain at the investiture vote.\n\u00c1balos also suggested that the Socialists are not entirely closed off to a joint executive with Unidas Podemos, as was the case after the April election, when Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias unsuccessfully lobbied for a coalition government with S\u00e1nchez. \u201cWe are open to listening and trying to reach deals.\u201d\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/11/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
