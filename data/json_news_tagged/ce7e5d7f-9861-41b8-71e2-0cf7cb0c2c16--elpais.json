The five-day long disturbances left 600 people injured, with protesters and officers equally affected by the violence. Four people lost eyes from the impact of rubber bullets fired by riot police, and one officer is still recovering in the intensive care unit.\nAn estimated 500 anti-establishment protesters were on the frontline of the disturbances, facing off against the officers. Police say the group was made up of pro-independence revolutionaries and anarchists. Another 200 young people joined the protests to demonstrate both peacefully or with rocks in their hands. They were brought to the street by the court sentence, but their reasons for being there go far beyond the independence drive.\n\u201cThere are a series of circumstances that have fed the flame: precarious jobs, mini-jobs, university fees and a sense of injustice,\u201d says Carles Feiza, a researcher in student movements at the Pompeu Fabra University in Catalonia. \u201cThis is the first time since the Transition [to democracy after the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975] that young people are seeing that they are going to live worse than their parents. An independent Catalonia is the only concrete utopia they have.\u201d\nEL PA\u00cdS spoke to five young people who took part in several protests in Barcelona last week. This is an extract of the conversations.\nThey don\u2019t listen to us, they don\u2019t give us a voice, things cannot be worse than they are\nThey have always sold me the idea that we would live better in an independent Catalonia. I am not convinced, but some things would certainly work. We wouldn\u2019t have to pay what doesn\u2019t correspond to us. I take care of a six-year-old girl to earn a bit of money. And on the weekends, I am a volunteer at a center for adults with disabilities. Because I live far from the university, I spend five hours a day on public transport and pay \u20ac200 every quarter. I pay \u20ac1,500 to study a degree in pedagogy at university, and if I wanted to do a master\u2019s it would cost me \u20ac3,000. At home \u2013 there are four of us, counting my brother \u2013 we live just off my father\u2019s salary, which is around \u20ac2,000.\nMy mother has been out of work for more than a year. She is a hard-core supporter of the independence movement. My father isn\u2019t, but he believes that young people have to take action. I see that they don\u2019t listen to us, they don\u2019t give us a voice, things cannot be worse than they are. And this \u2013 the protest \u2013 transcends the separatist drive. I don\u2019t want anything bad to happen, but I want the fires to be seen. The peaceful route has only led us to be shut down. And I am a person who is easily scared: I am not going to put myself on the frontline.\nYou have to defend the street\nI like rap, I write lyrics and poetry. I write about myself and what I see every day. I am not an anarchist but I consider myself anti-establishment. I think capitalism is a curse that only enriches a few. I am not a separatist, I think the idea of borders is crazy and it seems absurd to me to create more. But on October 1 [2017], I voted in favor of Catalan independence as a protest against the state. I have never torched a trash container or anything like it, but during the recent protests I did set up barricades and people there with me began to break up the ground with poles to take out rocks and throw them at police.\nI didn\u2019t think it was right to break up the ground because it\u2019s a space we all share, but what are you going to do. [The police] charged at us and they didn\u2019t fire [their rubber bullets] at the ground, which is what they the regulations say they should do. Why didn\u2019t I leave? Because the police should not go too far. You have to defend the streets, the police are a symbol of fascism to us. I am involved in this for a better future. The end doesn't justify the means, but if black people had not risen up they would still be slaves and if women had not stood up they wouldn\u2019t be able to vote. I am not inventing the wheel. I think we can hold dialogue and gain more privileges as a region, but remaining part of Spain. I don\u2019t want Catalonia to secede because I think it would create more conflict.\nWe either burn a trash container or we go unseen\nThey have just fired me from the makeup shop where I was working. I was earning \u20ac600 for 25 hours a week. I live with my father and his wife. They pay for my food and expenses. I wasn\u2019t able to go to university, I have been working since I finished secondary school. I am protesting because I need change. I need to look toward the future and see a way out, and an independent Catalonia could improve the situation. Of course, I am not saying that it is going to be that easy. But when I look at the horizon I see nothing. Do you understand? The sentence was like the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. I do not support violence but I feel like the only way of making them listen to us is to cause chaos. Nor am I happy that there is a police officer in the intensive care unit, but they have blinded us [with foam bullets]. How is that person, of my age, going to explain to their kids that they lost an eye defending their freedom of expression? I am not going to take part even in verbal violence, but I understand perfectly those who do, because we either burn a trash container or we go unseen.\nI am not a Catalan nationalist, I am not protesting for Catalonia\nI have set up barricades to block the streets and paralyze the city. I have also thrown rocks at the police, but only when they were coming for us. We are not burning things just for the sake of it. It is civil disobedience with an objective: to denounce Spain and the repression by its police. If we were a democratic country, a peaceful protest would have been enough. But these years of peaceful protests have done nothing. We needed people to see us. I understand that it is a disturbance, but this is the rage that has been stoked up in us. People are fed up.\nIn my home, my mother and I struggle to make ends meet. I have finished high school and have taken a year to work so I can pay to go to university. I would do any kind of work, but nobody calls me. I want to study biology, but I don\u2019t know if I will be able to afford the tuition. I believe an independent Catalonia would be better economically. The protests bring together all the frustration about our living conditions. I am not a Catalan nationalist, I am not protesting for Catalonia itself. I consider myself more Catalan than Spanish, but I am taking to the streets for the blows we have been dealt, for the sentence and because they are not paying us any attention. They won\u2019t let us vote, and that would solve everything.\nI am fed up with being looked down on for being Catalan\nI study at a [part private, part public] school and in my home money is not a problem. I would like to be a commercial pilot. I could train in the army but I don\u2019t see myself signing up. My father, who is also a separatist, does not want me to be a pilot, part of the military, or even Spanish. I wanted to protest not so much for the independence movement, but rather for justice, to protest against the unreasonable sentence that was given to the separatist leaders. I protested the day of the general strike [Friday, October 18] and my mother banned me from going out when she saw my bruises. \u201cYou are not going out again. If you\u2019re a masochist, I\u2019ll give you a beating.\u201d There are young people who believe in the cause and protest peacefully, and there are others who like setting fires and use it as an excuse to come out and cause unrest.\nI think Catalonia could manage by itself and that things would be much better for us. [The state] gives back less money than we give, when it should be proportional. Beyond the issue of economics, we feel like people hate us. I have friends in Zaragoza [a city in Spain\u2019s northeastern Arag\u00f3n region] who post things on Instagram saying: \u201cFuck Catalans, if you come here we are going to beat you up.\u201d I am fed up with going to places in Spain and being looked down on for being Catalan. There is also the matter of language, I think it\u2019s wrong for them to impose Spanish. The central government should hand over [more regional powers] and give us more autonomy. We are fighting for something that will affect the rest of our lives. If we don\u2019t take to the street, who will? I will die without seeing it, but knowing that I fought for something I believed in.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.", "date": "10/28/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
