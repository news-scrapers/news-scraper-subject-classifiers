They also found her guilty of two counts of inflicting psychological harm on Gabriel\u2019s parents, given that for 11 days after the child disappeared, there was an extensive search for him in which Quezada actively participated, making public shows of support for Gabriel\u2019s father.\nThe jurors spent two days deciding whether Quezada, a 45-year-old immigrant from Dominican Republic, committed murder or reckless homicide, as her defense argued. They also debated whether aggravating circumstances such as premeditation applied, as held by both the public and the private prosecution.\nThe jury concluded that Quezada killed the child in an intentional and sudden way\nThey concluded, in agreement with the public prosecutor, that she killed the child in an intentional and sudden way, using means to ensure his death without running any risk herself, and abusing his trust as a member of the family. The jury did not, however, find that there was premeditation nor did they conclude that she deliberately increased the suffering of the child, as the private prosecution held. They also refused her defense that she was acting under the effects of sleeping pills.\nSitting in a corner, Quezada listened to the verdict. For the first time in the trial, she did not shed a tear. She is now facing permanent reviewable prison, the Spanish equivalent of a life sentence, with a possibility of parole after a fixed term. This would make her the first woman to have received this punishment since it was introduced into law several years ago.\nJust two meters away from Quezada, Gabriel\u2019s parents Patricia Ram\u00edrez and \u00c1ngel Cruz listened intently. Once outside the courtroom, they expressed their gratitude to the jury for their decision. \u201cWe were going to fight to make sure this witch never sets foot on the street again,\u201d said Ram\u00edrez. \u201cPsychopaths should be locked away, far from society, so they can\u2019t hurt anyone,\u201d added Cruz.\nThe jury took just over 26 hours to reach their verdict, deliberating in a small room in the Almer\u00eda Provincial Court. They had to answer 142 questions that had been put to them about the case by the judge in charge, Alejandra Dodero.\nQuezada confessed to the killing after police caught her moving the eight-year-old\u2019s body in the trunk of her car\nBefore the jury retired, the judge briefly explained to them the differences between the charges brought by the public and the private prosecution, to help them determine which, if any, Quezada was guilty of.\nDodero explained that asesinato con alevos\u00eda occurs when the killer takes special care to ensure that he or she will not run any risk of being hurt, such as \u201cunexpectedly attacking someone who is part of your close family circle, and who therefore trusts you.\u201d This was the charge, among others, that the public prosecution had leveled at Quezada and of which she was found guilty.\nOn the other hand, asesinato con ensa\u00f1amiento implies causing deliberate and unnecessary pain just for the sake of it, \u201clike stabbing someone in the thigh, then in the legs and other non-vital organs, then cutting off a finger and showing it to the victim, and finally killing him by stabbing him in the heart,\u201d said Dodero. The private prosecution had argued that this was the case, based on a private medical report that stated that the child had been knocked unconscious, then left to suffer on the ground before Quezada smothered him around an hour later. This did not coincide with the official autopsy report, which found that the child had died immediately from suffocation. The jury did not find her guilty of this charge.\nThe jurors began their deliberations at 1.26pm on Wednesday, and concluded at 4pm on Thursday, bringing to an end seven intense days in court during which dozens of witnesses and investigators tried to shed light on a murder case that has gripped Spain.\nGabriel Cruz went missing on February 27, 2018 in Las Hortichuelas, a hamlet located inside Cabo de Gata natural park, a sparsely populated area in Almer\u00eda.\nBoth the private and the public prosecution\u00a0 described the crime as murder by a cold, calculating woman\nQuezada, who was then in a romantic relationship with the child\u2019s father, \u00c1ngel Cruz, confessed to the killing after police caught her moving the eight-year-old\u2019s body in the trunk of her car.\nBefore that, she had participated in an extensive search for the child, making public displays of affection for the father despite knowing that Gabriel lay dead inside a property in nearby Rodalquilar that belonged to Cruz.\nHer defense was based on the claim that the child attacked her and began verbally abusing her, and that she covered his mouth in an attempt to silence him. When she realized that Gabriel was no longer breathing, she panicked and buried the body in a shallow grave. Quezada told the court that when she was caught moving the body, she was planning to write letters of confession to the family and take her own life with sleeping pills.\nBoth the private and the public prosecution instead described the crime as murder by a cold, calculating woman who viewed Gabriel as an obstacle between herself and the boy\u2019s father. During the hearings, prosecutors also asked Quezada about her online searches for information about poisonous plants, and about the child\u2019s reported bouts of gastroenteritis after spending time with her. The death of her first child, who fell out of a window in Quezada\u2019s apartment in Burgos around 20 years ago \u2013 an incident that was treated at the time as a tragic accident but has raised further suspicions about Quezada since Gabriel\u2019s death \u2013 was also discussed in court. \u201cShe is an authentic sociopath,\u201d one of the prosecution lawyers stated about the defendant during the trial.\nAsked why she had planted one of Gabriel\u2019s shirts at a spot near an ex-boyfriend\u2019s house during the search for the eight-year-old, she had originally told the first judge in charge of the probe that she did it \u201cbecause she wanted to give hope\u201d to Gabriel\u2019s father. But at the trial in Almer\u00eda, she claimed instead that she did it because she wanted to get caught. \u201cI wanted them to apprehend me. I couldn\u2019t deal with it any more,\u201d she told the court on Tuesday.\n\u201cMay God forgive me,\u201d she said at the last hearing before the jury retired to deliberate the case.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter and Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/19/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
