The record number of participants reflects the political fragmentation in a country that is about to hold its fourth national election in four years on Sunday, and that not so long ago had a stable two-party system that saw the conservative Popular Party (PP) and left-wing Socialist Party (PSOE) take turns in power.\nWith just six days to go before the election, surveys show that no single party will secure a majority\nThe televised debate comes on the same day that King Felipe VI is scheduled to hand out a prize in Barcelona amid heavy security measures, with tensions still running high in Catalonia in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling that jailed nine pro-independence leaders. The issue of the Catalan secessionist drive is expected to figure prominently on the speakers\u2019 agenda during the debate tonight.\nWith just six days to go before Spaniards head for the polls, surveys show that no single party will secure enough of a majority to form a government, and political leaders have been trying to attract undecided centrist voters since the campaign kicked off last week.\nHere is a round-up of the campaigning so far.\nRepresentatives from seven of Spain\u2019s political parties took part in a live televised debate on Friday evening: Cayetana \u00c1lvarez de Toledo (Popular Party), Aitor Esteban (Basque Nationalist Party), Iv\u00e1n Espinosa de los Monteros (Vox), Irene Montero (Unidas Podemos), Gabriel Rufi\u00e1n (Catalan Republican Left), In\u00e9s Arrimadas (Ciudadanos) and Adriana Lastra (Socialist Party).\nCaretaker Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, of the Socialist Party (PSOE), was the target of much of the criticism from opposition groups during the debate, being blamed for the repeat elections.\nIrene Montero, the spokesperson for Unidas Podemos, accused the PSOE of using the crisis in Catalonia to seek a governing deal with the PP after the November 10 elections. She also claimed that S\u00e1nchez had gone on vacation for the entire month of August instead of negotiating a coalition with her party.\nMeanwhile, In\u00e9s Arrimadas, from the center-right Ciudadanos party, said that \u201cS\u00e1nchez was a boon for the pro-independence movement,\u201d while Iv\u00e1n Espinosa de los Monteros of far-right Vox argued that\u00a0 \u201cCatalonia is out of control, while they are constantly mounting a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d in the region.\nAt the close of the debate, the Basque Nationalist Left (PNV) spokesperson Aitor Esteban refused to shake the hand of Vox\u2019s Espinosa de los Monteros. The party later issued a statement explaining that the Vox politician had previously called Esteban and his colleagues \u201cracist and xenophobic.\u201d \u201cIt is not a question of being polite, but rather principles and dignity,\u201d the party said in a message. \u201cBasques do not shake hands with Francoists.\u201d\nOn Saturday, at a campaign rally in Valencia, caretaker Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez drew attention to how far-right Vox has gained influence in recent months, thanks to its support for coalition deals between the PP and Ciudadanos in the regional governments of Madrid, Andalusia and Murcia, as well as in Madrid City Hall.\n\u201cThe far-right is beaten by defending democratic principles and by isolating it,\u201d he told a crowd of 2,000 in Mislata, Valencia. \u201cBy condemning Francoism, sexism, its xenophobia and racism. Condemning its trivialization of gender violence. If the far right has its head held high right now it\u2019s because the PP, instead of isolating it, has joined its destiny with the far right.\u201d\nPablo Iglesias, the head of the leftist Unidas Podemos bloc, said at a rally in A Coru\u00f1a on Sunday that \u201cthere are a lot of people who are [supporters of our party] but just don\u2019t know it.\u201d\nIglesias also accused S\u00e1nchez of \u201cbeing leftist only during primaries and election campaigns.\u201d He said that S\u00e1nchez will do whatever Brussels asks of him, such as \u201cthe cuts\u201d that are coming up due to the \u201ceconomic slowdown.\u201d\nAt his own Sunday rally in Madrid, Popular Party (PP) leader Pablo Casado also criticized the PSOE, which is set to win the election with 121 seats, according to a recent poll.\nCasado said that S\u00e1nchez is benefiting from the unrest in Catalonia, where 300 police officers were injured and four people lost eyes during week-long street disturbances following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the case against Catalan separatist leaders. He said that S\u00e1nchez will be responsible for any incidents that take place during the king\u2019s visit today.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on when you see the king going to Catalonia as though he were going to a civil confrontation zone?\u201d asked Casado. \u201cMr S\u00e1nchez, this isn\u2019t Burkina Faso, this is not Yemen, this is Spain. Put some order in Catalonia once and for all. Stop negotiating with the separatists.\u201d\nCiudadanos (Citizens), which began as an anti-independence party in Catalonia but soon jumped to the national stage, is facing something of a crisis at the November 10 election, with its support having plummeted in the polls. Its leader, Albert Rivera, has already addressed questions about whether he will step down if these predictions come true. \u201cI\u2019m an attorney,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI worked before politics. There are other candidates who have never worked a day. I\u2019m in politics because I\u2019m passionate about it. I\u2019m not driven by clinging to a seat or a job, just this country.\u201d But sources close to the Ciudadanos leader say that he will not quit, even if the result next Sunday is bad.\nThe party\u2019s campaign team is concentrating on the two million or so indecisive voters, and Rivera is prepared for the campaign. He cleared his diary for the last three days and has spent the time preparing for tonight\u2019s debate. He raised a few eyebrows, however, when he released a video at the weekend presenting his \u201csecret weapon\u201d for the debate: a puppy named Lucas. \u201cThose who attack me in the debate will have to answer to Lucas,\u201d he said in the light-hearted Instagram recording.\nOs presento a mi arma secreta para el debate de ma\u00f1ana \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc36 #perro #perros #animales #animals #debate #debateelectoral\nA post shared by  Albert Rivera D\u00edaz (@albertriveradiaz) on Nov 3, 2019 at 4:06am PST\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter and Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/04/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
