That\u2019s according to the latest survey from the regional government\u2019s official CEO research center, which shows that 41.9% of Catalan citizens are in favor of independence while 48.8% reject it \u2013 the latter being the highest figure since July 2017.\nThe survey was carried out between September 16 and October 7 of this year, and is based on interviews with 1,500 people. The polling was performed before a recent Supreme Court ruling that jailed nine pro-independence leaders for their involvement in the 2017 pro-secession drive and a unilateral declaration of independence.\nThe polling was carried out before a recent Supreme Court ruling that jailed nine pro-independence leaders\nCompared to the previous CEO survey, released in July of this year, the percentage of Catalans opposed to independence is up. The results released in the summer saw 44% in favor of independence and those against at 48.3%. The gap between the two sides in July was 4.3 percentage points, whereas this latest survey puts that distance at 6.9 percentage points.\nThe poll results also contain another piece of data showing a fall in support for secession from Spain. On answering the question \u201cDo you believe that Catalonia should be\u2026,\u201d most of those interviewed \u2013 33.6% \u2013 chose \u201can independent state\u201d from the four options listed. But this is the lowest percentage for this question since the 2012 edition of the poll. Just 18 months ago, in April 2018, this response was backed by 40.8% of those surveyed. The second-most-popular answer is the current situation, \u201can autonomous region\u201d (28%, up one point on the last survey), followed by \u201ca state within a federal Spain\u201d (21.6%, nearly three points down on July), and \u201ca region of Spain\u201d (7.8%, 1.5 points down on the last survey).\nNearly 59% of respondents said that Catalonia\u2019s autonomy is insufficient, but this is the lowest figure for some time\nThe regional government\u2019s survey also asks about Catalonia\u2019s level of autonomy. Nearly 59% of respondents said that it is insufficient, but this is the lowest figure for some time. Not since 2007 have fewer than 60% of those surveyed given that answer. Meanwhile, 25.1% said in this survey that the current level of autonomy is sufficient, the highest figure for this question since 2017, when 26.4% of respondents said the same. Just 6.5% of people surveyed answered that Catalonia has \u201ctoo much autonomy.\u201d\nAt Sunday\u2019s repeat general election, the pro-independence parties (the Catalan Republican Left, Together for Catalonia and the far-left CUP) secured 42.59% of the vote in the region, while those groups that are against secession picked up 39.85%. The latter block includes political parties as diverse as the Catalan Socialist Party (PSC), the conservative Popular Party (PP), center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) and far-right Vox. En Com\u00fa Podem, a coalition of Catalunya en Com\u00fa and Podemos, falls between the two blocs, given that it wants to see a referendum on Catalan independence. That group took 14.18% of the vote in Sunday\u2019s elections in Catalonia.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/15/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
