At 8am French officers from the National Police and National Gendarmerie began to use pepper spray and batons to forcibly remove demonstrators from their section of the highway, known as the A9, near Le Perthus. By then the highway had been blocked for 24 hours. The Spanish Civil Guard and the Mossos moved in from their side at around 10.30am.\nOn Monday morning, more than 2,000 people cut off the busy highway crossing, which is a major route for freight trucks. The roadblock created long delays on alternative roads such as the N-II Spanish national motorway, where traffic was at a standstill for 10 kilometers.\nLa @guardiacivil saca a un peque\u00f1o grupo de tres que estaba en la primera l\u00ednea, sentados https://t.co/G7qlRkmxhM pic.twitter.com/P44BTw9LPP\n \u201cThe Civil Guard removes a small group of three protestors who were sitting on the front line,\u201d tweets EL PA\u00cdS reporter Rebeca Carranco.\nBy Tuesday afternoon the protest had moved five kilometers south to the spot where the AP-7 and N-II converge. The National Police and the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra were trying to clear the area at around 4pm.\nThe Spanish Confederation of Freight Transportation CETM had warned that the roadblock could have a daily economic impact of \u20ac15 million and affect 20,000 trucks taking goods across the border. Democratic Tsunami has announced three days of street action.\nThe protesters had set up a large platform on the side of the highway leading into Spain, and made a barricade with construction material in the opposite direction into France.\nAccording to Spanish government sources, Spain\u2019s caretaker Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marklaska and his French counterpart Christophe Castaner were \u201cin constant communication\u201d about the situation. The French riot police had orders to clear the border but decided not to take action until Tuesday morning.\nDemocratic Tsunami has called this latest protest their \u201cmost ambitious action,\u201d and promised more demonstrations if a political solution is not found for the crisis in Catalonia. The group is calling for the \u201cright to self-determination, freedom for the prisoners, exiles and reprisal victims,\u201d in reference to the Catalan separatists in jail or in self-imposed exile for their role in the 2017 breakaway bid, \u201cand the free pursuit of basic rights.\u201d\nDemocratic Tsunami explained in a statement that the aim of the roadblock is to make the international community \u201cunderstand\u201d that the only solution to the crisis in Catalonia is to \u201csit down and talk.\u201d Failing to do so will only further isolate the breakaway region, they maintain. According to the statement, the roadblock near the French border is meant to symbolize this isolation.\nAsk for at least one of these days off from work. You have to be available to go to different parts of the region, and if you can, spend the night outside\nDemocratic Tsunami instructions\nIn a statement issued on Friday, the group said that the protest will last three days. \u201cAsk for at least one of these days off from work. You have to be available to go to different parts of the region, and if you can, spend the night outside,\u201d the group told supporters, adding that they would need to bring warm clothes, cellphone batteries, food, sleeping bags and tents, and to display a non-violent attitude.\nDemocratic Tsunami was activated on September 2 with the public support of the Catalan regional premier Quim Torra, his deputy premier Pere Aragon\u00e8s, and the speaker of the regional parliament, Roger Torrent. Its leaders are currently unknown, but police believe that it was conceived during a meeting in Switzerland between the former Catalan premier Carles Puigdemont, Torra, representatives of Catalan nationalist parties, and pro-independence civic associations ANC and \u00d2mnium Cultural.\nThe protest comes just after Spaniards returned to the polls on Sunday for the fourth general election in as many years. The far-right party Vox, which campaigned heavily against the Catalan independence movement, made the biggest gains of the night, winning 52 seats in Spain\u2019s lower house, the Congress of Deputies.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson and Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/12/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
