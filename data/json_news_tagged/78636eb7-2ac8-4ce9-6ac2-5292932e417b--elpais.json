It was much tastier than I had imagined. Now I try to eat it whenever I can \u2013 six or seven times a year.\u201d\nBut in spite of her enthusiasm for the Spanish delicacy, Sun Ruiheng has not been able to enjoy it carved straight from the bone \u2013 until now.\nI try to eat it whenever I can \u2013 six or seven times a year\nTranslator Sun Ruiheng\nShoulders and legs of Spanish ham were only allowed into China this October. According to Mar\u00eda Naranjo, the director of the Food, Wine and Gastronomy department at the Spanish Institute for Foreign Trade (ICEX), it took years of lobbying by Spain\u2019s Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Ministry to convince Chinese authorities to give the green light, though ready-sliced ham has been imported since 2007.\nThe process to request permission to export the product began last year during Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to Spain. By September of this year, the remaining paperwork was completed and the first whole hams, on the bone, were sent to China at the beginning of October. As the minimum curing period of 313 days has also been reduced, there is the possibility that other products such as pork loin, spicy chorizo sausage and other cold cuts could also be exported, says Naranjo.\nSpain\u2019s ham shoulders and legs will debut at the China International Import Export in Shanghai, which was inaugurated on Tuesday by Xi himself\u00ad\u00ad \u2013 a big deal for a product being hailed as the \u201cSpanish caviar.\u201d Ham companies Embutidos Ferm\u00edn and Cinco Jotas are among the first Spanish firms to get a foot in the door of the Chinese market, but there are many waiting to join them, sparking hopes that Spanish gastronomy is about to take off in China.\nIn 2014, \u20ac2 million-worth of ham was sold to China\n\u201cThis is an extraordinary chance to promote our best products,\u201d says Carlos T\u00f3rtola, economic advisor and head of trade at the Spanish embassy in Beijing. \u201cIt\u2019s a product that is exclusive to our gastronomy with characteristics that make it gourmet. What\u2019s more, the term ib\u00e9rico is starting to be associated with quality goods in China, the biggest global market of luxury products.\u201d\nIndeed, sales of Spanish ham and other pork-based cold cuts in general are on the rise in China. In 2014, \u20ac2 million worth of ham was sold, according to the Chinese Customs Department. This year, that figure is expected to rise to \u20ac7 million. And with the new legislation, the figure could jump even higher.\nEmbutidos Ferm\u00edn and Cinco Jotas are among the almost 30 companies now authorized to sell in China. Another 20 are still waiting for the go-ahead. \u201cThere is a lot of expectation because demand might be overwhelming,\u201d says Santiago Mart\u00edn, the owner of Embutidos Ferm\u00edn.\nAlthough ham in China is still a luxury product, the market has the potential to grow. Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez, the joint owner of family company Castro y Gonz\u00e1lez, says China is already their main export market. With the new regulation, they expect to double the 1,500 bone-in hams they sell now within the space of two to three years.\nThe Chinese like the culture they see in Spain; with the ham carved from the bone\nSantiago Mart\u00edn, owner of Embutidos Ferm\u00edn\nMeanwhile, Santiago Mart\u00edn expects to increase his \u20ac12 million turnover by 20% next year thanks to exports to China. \u201cI have just sent a container filled with hams,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the 12 years I have been exporting to China, I have never been able able to fill one.\u201d\nIn fact, such are the expectations that together with his distributor in China, Gonz\u00e1lez is already starting to develop projects to train Chinese catering staff how to store, carve and present the ham.\n\u201cMy distributors tell me that the Chinese like the ham culture they see in Spain; with the ham carved from the bone, and that is what they want,\u201d says Mart\u00edn.\nUntil now, most of the demand in China has come from restaurants, hotels, luxury supermarkets and online platforms specializing in delicacies, says T\u00f3rtola, while Gonz\u00e1lez describes the typical consumer as someone from either Beijing or Shanghai, \u201cfrom the middle to upper classes, open-minded and well-informed.\u201d\nBecause of this target market, T\u00f3rtola dismisses the possibility of imitation brands. Not only is the Chinese consumer increasingly well-informed, he says, but the Chinese authorities are committed to protecting intellectual property rights and are aware of the health risks of imitation food products.\nAs far as the price is concerned, town planner Zhou Zongsu, 28, thinks Spanish ham is expensive. He first tasted it several years ago while living in London but has not had it since returning to China. \u201cIt is too expensive here but when I\u2019m a millionaire, I will stuff my face with it.\u201d\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/06/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
