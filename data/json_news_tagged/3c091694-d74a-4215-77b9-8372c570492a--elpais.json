On Monday several EU sources confirmed that \u201cwhat we are doing at this point is initiating talks with several countries to explore the options of a voluntary relocation process.\u201d The names of these countries were not provided.\nThe crew has warned about worsening conditions aboard the ship, as food and water become scarce and patience wears thin among the 160 rescued migrants and 19 aid workers.\nOn Sunday afternoon, the ship\u2019s captain received permission from Malta and Italy to evacuate three ill migrants for medical reasons, the EFE news agency reported.\nMalta has agreed to take in two women, one of whom shows signs of pneumonia, while the other has a neurological condition. Italy said it will accept a man with symptoms of tuberculosis. But nothing has been said about the remaining 157 passengers.\nSince June of last year, authorities in Malta and Italy have been refusing port entry to rescue vessels operated by non-profit groups, unless a previous agreement exists to relocate the migrants in other countries.\nThe European Commission has said it will not intervene in this case until a request is made by one of the member states, but no country has so far come forward.\nShip workers report that conditions on board the Open Arms are deteriorating rapidly, especially after 39 new people were rescued before dawn on Saturday, adding to the 120 who were already on board. Fights have broken out as people struggle with the heat, the humidity, the food shortages, the overcrowding and the anxiety of not knowing what comes next.\nUS actor Richard Gere personally delivered food and water to the migrants on Thursday of last week, and asked for international support.\nBuilt in 1974, the Open Arms was not made to hold so many people for such a long time. The 160 passengers, which include 30 minors and two babies, are packed into 180 square meters and there are only two toilets.\nThe situation deteriorated further on Saturday, when the desalination equipment broke down, forcing workers to ration out the fresh water.\nThe menu on board mostly consists of rice and couscous, said V\u00edctor, a retired driving instructor for the Basque police force who now volunteers as a cook aboard the Open Arms. \u201cWe try to add green peas or some other ingredient to give it some color and flavor. But it\u2019s all really basic,\u201d said another volunteer, Francisco Gentico.\nThe media have been wondering for days whether the Open Arms will eventually force its way into a nearby port, as Carola Rackete, the captain of a ship operated by the German non-profit group Sea Watch, did in late June. Oscar Camps, the founder of the Spanish aid group Proactiva Open Arms, has told EL PA\u00cdS that this option will only be considered in the event of \u201ca humanitarian emergency.\u201d\nThe 160 passengers are packed into 180 square meters and there are only two toilets\nCamps also criticized the Spanish government for failing to work towards a solution, and challenged Spanish leaders to take Italy and Malta before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in Hamburg.\nSpain\u2019s Socialist Party (PSOE) government, which welcomed 400 migrants on board the Open Arms into the country last year, has refused to give the ship port entry this time around. \u201cWe hope they are acting in accordance with international conventions and national regulations,\u201d said acting government spokesperson Isabel Cela\u00e1 on August 2.\nAfter allowing several rescue ships into Spanish ports throughout the early months of the Pedro S\u00e1nchez administration, authorities have since taken an increasingly tough stance on migrant rescue activities.\nSeven months ago, the Spanish government banned the NGO Proactiva Open Arms from completing rescue missions in the central Mediterranean Sea, on the basis that their ship was not equipped to safely carry out long journeys. But in late June, the NGO ignored the ban and sailed to the area.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/12/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
