The ruling states that the Irish airline\u2019s rule is \u201cabusive as it curtails the rights that the passenger has recognized by [article 97 of the Air Navigation Law], generating an imbalance of benefits between the contracting parties to the detriment of the consumer.\u201d The tribunal has ruled that this clause should be declared null and void and removed from the contract.\nThe ruling originated with a complaint from a passenger who was asked to pay \u20ac20 at the boarding gate for her hand luggage\nThe ruling originated with a complaint from a passenger who was asked to pay \u20ac20 at the boarding gate for her 10-kilogram item of hand luggage because she had not purchased a priority fare in advance. The Madrid court has sided with the women\u2019s claim and has forced the airline to return the \u20ac20 fee (plus interest) but not the \u20ac10 she asked for in damages.\nThe court explains in the sentence that the issue that the dispute refers to is \u201can important legal issue as to whether the airline can charge an additional cost to the passenger for carrying hand luggage\u201d \u2013 not handbags or shopping bags from the airport, \u201cbut bags or backpacks in which passengers are carrying their clothes, personal belongings and other objects.\u201d\nThe ruling mentions that the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has already addressed the issue and distinguished between luggage destined for the hold and \u201cunchecked hand luggage.\u201d Hold items aren\u2019t considered as an essential for passenger transport, and therefore companies may charge extra for them. However, \u201chand luggage or unchecked luggage\u201d is said to be an \u201cessential element of air transport so companies are obliged to carry it without demanding any type of extra charge on top of the price of the ticket.\u201d\nThe Irish carrier told news agency Europa Press on Wednesday afternoon that the ruling \u201cwill not affect\u201d its luggage policy \u201ceither in the past or in future cases.\u201d According to the airline, the Madrid Court ruling \u201crefers to a specific case that has misinterpreted\u201d their commercial freedom to determine the size of cabin bags allowed on board their aircraft.\nRyanair said the ruling \u201cwill not affect\u201d its luggage policy \u201ceither in the past or in future cases\u201d\nRyanair\u2019s new baggage policy came into effect on November 1 of last year, and obliges passengers to pay should they want to bring a larger piece of hand luggage on board, such as a 10-kilogram trolley case, for example. These passengers have to buy a priority ticket, of which there are a limited number. Only smaller bags are allowed onto the plane for free. Some countries, such as Italy, fined the company for \u201cdeceiving\u201d the consumer with this new luggage policy, on the basis that it wasn\u2019t transparent in terms of the true price of a ticket.\nAccording to Almudena Vel\u00e1zquez, lawyer for the consumer-rights platform reclamador.es, while the sentence does not \u201cdeclare any contractual clauses null and void, but rather orders the return of the sum the passenger was forced to pay, it does set out a path for similar cases in which additional amounts are demanded in a completely contrived way and that serve, in reality, to increase the final price of the ticket, to impose fictitious restrictions that are not supported in any rules and that can only be overcome if you pay an additional amount.\u201d\nEnglish version by Alicia Kember.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/21/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
