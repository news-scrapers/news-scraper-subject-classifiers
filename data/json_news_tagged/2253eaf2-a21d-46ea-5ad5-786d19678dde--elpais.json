L., the Spanish defense and security company in charge of protecting the Ecuadorian embassy in London during Julian Assange\u2019s long stay there, called on his team to catalogue \u201cthe Russian and American citizens\u201d who visited the cyberactivist as a maximum priority, according to testimonies and documents to which EL PA\u00cdS has had access. The company allegedly spied on the WikiLeaks founder for the US intelligence services, and in the wake of revelations published by this newspaper is being investigated by the Spanish High Court, the Audiencia Nacional.\nMorales gave written instructions to his employees in London for them to give advance warning of the priority targets from both countries. All of the information collected about these and other visitors was sent to an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server in Jerez de la Frontera, the headquarters of UC Global S. L., in southern Spain. This kind of \u201cbig brother\u201d was the place were all of the information collected was stored in an orderly fashion, including files from cellphones, profiles by nationality (Russians, Americans, Germans, etc.), professions, and documents from attorneys, diplomats, journalists, doctors, and so on.\nEmployees who worked for UC Global S. L. have told this newspaper that the CIA had access to this server\nEmployees who worked for UC Global S. L. have told this newspaper that the CIA had access to this server, and that Morales did not want to reveal the identity of \u201chis American friends\u201d when there were technical problems and there was a request for contact with the client.\nThe IP numbers registered come from the US and one of them matches a company that provides security services for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). A study of the reports that were created over a period of years by this company reveals that international current affairs and events surrounding the cyberactivist defined and modified the objectives of the company and its \u201cAmerican clients.\u201d\nThe Spanish company\u2019s interest in Russian citizens multiplied due to suspicions that the WikiLeaks founder had a relationship with the Russian intelligence services, something that he has always denied. Former special counsel for the United States Department of Justice, Robert Mueller, investigated the attempts by Russia to interfere in the 2016 elections via the hacking of accounts belonging to the Democratic Party and its candidate, Hillary Clinton. Tens of thousands of mails were published by WikiLeaks and its founder became the primary target of the CIA and its director, Mike Pompeo, according to reporting from The New York Times in 2018. The Mueller investigation eventually proved the interference from Moscow, although it did not find evidence to confirm that there was a conspiracy with the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, his colleagues or any American citizen.\nThe Spanish company\u2019s interest in Russian citizens multiplied on suspicions that the WikiLeaks founder had a relationship with Russian intelligence services\nThe focus on the WikiLeaks founder\u2019s Russian visitors intensified when there were suspicions that he was trying to get out of the embassy in 2017 with Ecuadorian diplomatic status and head to Russia, something that his lawyers and Assange himself deny. Glenn Greenwald, the man whom Edward Snowden turned to in order to reveal the mass espionage being carried out by the NSA, had photos taken of the Russian visas in his passport, as well as his cellphone. There were similar steps taken with the Russian journalists who visited the Australian.\nThe spying on the American visitors is explained by the interest in finding out who was supporting the cause of the man who uncovered the most secret military actions by the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. The distribution of that confidential information has prompted the US justice system to have Assange extradited from the United Kingdom, and he is facing charges that carry a total of 175 years in jail.\nThe monitoring of the dozens of people who visited Assange during the seven years he was in the embassy was comprehensive. But in the case of the priority targets \u2013 Americans, Russians, attorneys and journalists \u2013 it was intensified as much as possible. Employees of UC Global S. L. took apart and photographed the cellphones of American journalists who visited the founder of WikiLeaks, according to testimony and graphic documents to which EL PA\u00cdS has had access. Their visits were monitored, the video and audio were recorded, and reports about the conversations were drawn up and were sent to the server in Jerez de la Frontera, to which the CIA allegedly had access.\nAll of the people who visited the cyberactivist during his stay at the diplomatic building were obliged to hand over their bags, computers, electronic devices and cellphones at a security checkpoint. What the assortment of attorneys, journalists, politicians, doctors and friends of Assange who visited the embassy were unaware of is that some of them had been designated by Morales as \u201cpriority targets.\u201d\nAnd that involved a report for each of them with the date of the meeting, a copy of their passport, the content of the conversation and a video of the meeting. And on some occasions, opening up the casing of their cellphone in order to locate and photograph its International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, a unique code that identifies a device and is one of the most valuable pieces of information for anyone looking to hack a phone. When a cellphone connects to a network, this identity number is automatically transmitted.\nThe focus on the WikiLeaks founder\u2019s Russian visitors intensified when there were suspicions that he was trying to get out of the embassy in 2017\nMorales, who is a former member of the Spanish Marines\u2019 Special Infantry Operations Unit, requested in a \u201cconfidential\u201d email that his team send him information about the composition of the walls that surrounded Assange\u2019s room, photographs of its interior, the characteristics of the furniture, data about the embassy\u2019s Wi-Fi, and the official list of phone numbers at the embassy. He also wanted to know who lived in and occupied the rest of the building, which is located in the central London neighborhood of Knightsbridge.\nIn private meetings with his colleagues, the owner of UC Global S. L. told them that his company \u201cwas playing in the first division\u201d and that he \u201chad passed over to the dark side.\u201d His visits to the US multiplied and in one of his mails he requested that his colleagues \u201cmanage my location with care, in particular my visits to the United States.\u201d References to \u201cthe American friends\u201d were constant.\nThe video cameras with built-in microphones recorded non-stop in different areas of the embassy from the fall of 2017 onward, and the original hard disks were taken to Spain and handed over to Morales. The director of UC Global S. L. has not responded to calls from this newspaper to request his version of events.\nThe Canadian actress and model Pamela Anderson, who is a friend of Julian Assange and was a regular visitor of the WikiLeaks\u2019 founder in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, was also spied on by the team from UC Global S. L. Their meetings were recorded and during one of them, Anderson, who was concerned about her security, wrote her secret passcodes for her cellphone, iPad and other electronic devices by hand on a piece of paper, a document that was photographed by the employees of the Spanish security company.\nAmong the members of the press whose cellphones were photographed are Lowell Bergman, 74, a veteran investigative journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize and worked at The New York Times. He visited Assange on October 9, 2017.\nEllen Nakashima, a specialist in national security at The Washington Post, and Evgeny Morozov, a doctor at Harvard University and specialist in technological issues, as well as being a contributor at EL PA\u00cdS, had both sides of their cellphones photographed. The same thing happened to Timothy Eric Ladbrooke, the cyberactivist\u2019s main doctor, according to images that are in the possession of EL PA\u00cdS.\nThe written account penned by an employee of UC Global S. L. on December 15, 2017 about the visit by the journalist from The Washington Post, reads: \u201cI took her phone, her recorder, I took out the battery, I tried to keep it, but the woman remembered it at the exit.\u201d\nAndy M\u00fcller-Maguhn, the well-known German hacker, was one of the people who aroused the most interest among the UC Global S. L. security staff. During his visits, photos were taken of the inside of his travel bag, his phones were opened and they took pictures of the numbers of his cellphones and cameras.\ninvestigacion@elpais.es\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/08/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
