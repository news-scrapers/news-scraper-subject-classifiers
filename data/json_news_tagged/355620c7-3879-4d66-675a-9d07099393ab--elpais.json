[...] After everything they\u2019ve done to us!\u201d The incident has been captured on video (above).\nThe Francos had been planning to turn their grandfather\u2019s exhumation \u2013 which they battled in the courts for 16 months \u2013 into a public tribute to the late dictator. But upon their arrival at the Valley of the Fallen they were made to hand in their cellphones and leave behind a pre-constitutional flag of Spain that had covered Franco\u2019s coffin on the day of his original burial, on November 23, 1975. The family had intended to place the same flag on the coffin on Thursday.\nThe cellphones were returned at the cemetery, but the police detected a metallic signal at the spot where Francis Franco was placed inside the family crypt, and suspected that he might be carrying a pen containing a small camera. When an officer attempted to search him, the latter refused: \u201cThis is where I draw the line!\u201d\nBefore that, the police had seized a cellphone from one of Franco\u2019s great-granddaughters and deleted images that she had taken moments earlier, according to sources in the Franco family. It was then that the scuffle with the police took place. Francis Franco told an officer: \u201cYou\u2019re not the boss around here, that man over there is the boss.\u201d He then pointed at F\u00e9lix Bola\u00f1os, a government official who has maintained good relations with the Franco family and their lawyer in recent weeks. Bola\u00f1os approached the group and mediated to reduce the tension, while reminding the relatives of the ban on videos and photographs.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/25/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
