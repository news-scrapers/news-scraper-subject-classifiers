And while 80% of respondents were thinking of making investments last year, this figure has now dropped to 73%.\nSpain has the EU\u2019s second-highest jobless rate, and a public debt close to 100% of GDP\nMeanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is forecasting slower global growth due to trade tensions and other risks to the world economy. In Europe, heavyweights like Germany and Italy are on the brink of a recession, although Rafael Dom\u00e9nech, of BBVA Research, says that despite a summer filled with bad news, things seem to have calmed down.\nFor now at least, the Spanish economy is proving surprisingly resilient. Despite the prolonged political deadlock, output continues to grow above the European average: household consumption, investment and government spending are fueling growth rates of 2%.\nBut it seems inevitable that Spain will eventually suffer from the same symptoms as its neighbors, and they will be compounded by domestic weak points such as having the EU\u2019s second-highest jobless rate, and a public debt close to 100% of GDP.\nDespite the prolonged political deadlock, output continues to grow above the European average\nA new crisis would find Spain unprepared to deal with the consequences: the public accounts leave little margin for stimulating growth through fiscal policy, and monetary policy cannot do much more than it already has: the European Central Bank has practically used up its arsenal of tools.\nThe last labor force survey in Spain, the EPA, shows that the unemployment rate has dropped below 14% for the first time in a decade, but that job creation in the third quarter was the slowest since 2012, when Spain was in a recession.\nMar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez, a senior economist at the think tank Funcas, rejects any worst-case scenarios. \u201cWe\u2019d been expecting a soft slowdown for a long time, and that\u2019s what the figures are showing,\u201d she says.\nThe challenges she sees ahead for the next government of Spain are, \u201cin the short run, dealing with the slowdown without significantly damaging the public accounts. And in the long run, preparing Spain for the technology revolution that is already underway. We are not prepared for it, and no measures are being taken. Some decisions are even headed in the opposite direction.\u201d\nDom\u00e9nech of BBVA Research underscores the lost opportunities for introducing reforms as a result of the political deadlock, which is blocking progress on important issues such as regional funding, pensions, the labor market and education. This expert estimates that the stalemate has cost the Spanish economy between 150,000 and 200,000 jobs in the last four years, which have seen Spaniards go to the polls in national elections three times already, with a fourth one coming up this Sunday.\n\u201cWe need training plans. And there is no global strategy for the auto sector,\u201d says \u00c1lvaro Herrero, a top manager at a Santander-based SME that makes metal parts for automobiles. This company has dropped its plans to hire more personnel after sales forecasts were sharply reduced from last year. \u201cWe need a government that sends out clear signals.\u201d\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/07/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
