Instead of gaining weight in the national economy, industry is retreating.\nThe latest indicators point to a slowdown in manufacturing, increasing the risk that industry\u2019s contribution to GDP could fall below last year\u2019s figure of 14%. The only time when this number was 20% was in the 1990s.\nSpain\u2019s industrial sector is more exposed to international events than other areas of the economy, and it has been feeling the effects of the ongoing China-US trade war, as well as Brexit, as the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union is commonly known, and the sluggishness of the German economy. Still, Spain has been more resilient to the global slowdown because its industrial sector is smaller than those of other countries.\nThe only sectors doing well are pulp and paper and pharmaceuticals\nThe consultancy company Equipo Econ\u00f3mico warns that \u201cthere has been a contraction in the export of goods, and even more intensely in imports, as a result of the increasingly complex international scenario.\u201d\nFigures show that industrial activity only grew 0.1% in the second quarter of this year compared with 2.3% growth for the whole of the economy, according to figures from the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE). Industry contributed 2,000 more jobless claims (up to 165,600) on a year when the number of unemployed in Spain has dropped by around 260,000, according to the latest EPA workforce survey.\nIndustry has also struggled with several high-profile factory closures (La Naval shipyard, aluminum giant Alcoa and wind turbine maker Vestas). Meanwhile, auto production fell 5.6% in the first half of the year due to the sluggishness of both the domestic and international markets. \u201cIt is a relevant drop, but Spain is suffering from the same trend affecting Europe, and resisting better than countries such as Germany (-12%), the United Kingdom (-21%) and Italy (-18%),\u201d says Mario Armero, vice-president of ANFAC, the Spanish automaker business association.\nAuto production fell 5.6% in the first half of the year\nSteel posted \u201ca very good 2018, but 2019 is not going that well,\u201d says Andr\u00e9s Barcel\u00f3, head of the sector\u2019s association UNESID. \u201cLast year we grew 2% and this year we are forecasting growth of 1%.\u201d\nChemicals, which advanced 2.6% last year, will be happy to grow 1.5% by the end of 2019. That\u2019s according to Juan Antonio Labad, the head of FEIQUE, the Spanish business association for the chemical sector, who added that industry is also hampered by governance issues. In early August the sector asked acting Industry Minister Reyes Maroto for a committee on industrial affairs to represent all government ministries and to unify regional policies.\nThe only sectors doing well are paper and pharmaceuticals. \u201cLast year we grew 8.7% and we are investing heavily to access more innovative markets,\u201d says Carlos Reinoso, head of the ASPAPEL association for manufacturers of paper and cardboard. \u201cThe pharmaceutical industry has not registered any contraction for now,\u201d say sources at Farmaindustria, the national association covering the pharmaceuticals sector in Spain.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/29/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
