There were 14 men and one woman on board, aged between 18 and 30, whose countries of origin were listed as Eritrea, Sudan, Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, Liberia and Ethiopia.\nThis latest crisis has newly illustrated the EU\u2019s inability to come up with a common immigration policy\nThese migrants were part of a larger group of 151 people who were rescued in the Central Mediterranean by a non-profit vessel named the Open Arms in early August.\nDue to Italy and Malta\u2019s closed-port policies, the ship remained at sea for 19 days while EU member states negotiated a deal to share out the new arrivals. The Open Arms was eventually allowed to dock in the Italian island of Lampedusa after prosecutors issued orders for the migrants to be disembarked due to critical conditions on board the ship.\nThis latest crisis has newly illustrated the EU\u2019s inability to come up with a common immigration policy that is acceptable to all member states. The case has also had domestic repercussions, with Spain\u2019s acting Socialist Party (PSOE) facing accusations of inconsistency in its immigration policy.\nUnder the recently negotiated scheme, Spain agreed to take in 15 people while France, Germany, Romania, Portugal and Luxembourg offered to accept other migrants from the Open Arms.\nThe Italian prosecutor's instructions to disembark them in Lampedusa came just as the Spanish government had ordered the Audaz to go out and aid the struggling rescue vessel, where conditions had been deteriorating rapidly.\nThe new arrivals in Spain will be admitted into C\u00e1diz\u2019s immigrant services network. For now none of them have applied for asylum, although it remains an option, said Labor Minister Magdalena Valerio.\nThis is the fourth time that the Open Arms, run by a Catalan non-profit group, has taken rescued migrants to Spain: one time to Barcelona and three times to C\u00e1diz.\nThe Spanish government\u2019s management of the situation has drawn criticism from both the left and the right, forcing acting deputy PM Carmen Calvo to defend the executive\u2019s actions.\nIn an extraordinary congressional appearance requested by the leftist group Unidas Podemos, Calvo on Thursday underscored that irregular arrivals through the Strait of Gibraltar have dropped 43%. She also noted Morocco\u2019s increased cooperation in the last 14 months.\n\u201cTo the exceptions, we have responded with international legislation, respecting human rights,\u201d she said referring to Open Arms. The right accuses the government of attracting human smuggling networks after Spain took in the Aquarius, another rescue ship carrying migrants that was rejected by Italy and Malta. And Unidas Podemos is critical of the fact that the Pedro S\u00e1nchez administration has announced it will remove the barbed wire from border fences in the Spanish exclave cities of Ceuta and Melilla, while \u201cgiving \u20ac35 million to Morocco, which has barbed wire on its side,\u201d said party official Noelia Vera.\nThe session took place three weeks before the deadline to reach a political deal that will allow a new government to be formed in Spain following the general election of April 28. If no candidate is successful, Spaniards will go to the polls again in November.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/30/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
