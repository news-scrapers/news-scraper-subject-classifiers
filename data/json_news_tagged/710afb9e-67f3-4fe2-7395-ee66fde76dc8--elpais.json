One of the first to react was one of the defendants themselves: Oriol Junqueras, the Catalan Republican Left president and the deputy regional premier in October 2017, which was when the events being tried took place. He has been sentenced to 13 years by the court for sedition and misuse of public funds. \u201cThere is no other option than to construct a new state to flee from this one, which persecutes democrats, bans voting and protest, and jails [people] for their political ideas,\u201d he wrote via social media, in a message published by his colleagues.\nThe current speaker in the Catalan regional government, Roger Torrent, also posted a message on social media. \u201cToday we have all been convicted, not just 12 people,\u201d he said.\nA total of 100 years in prison. It\u2019s outrageous\nFormer Catalan premier Carles Puigdemont\nThe Catalan government and parliament are planning to react to the sentence from midday today. Regional premier Quim Torra will make an institutional statement, while the parliament will call a special session for this week. Catalan regional deputies have cleared their public schedules this week in anticipation of instructions from Torra. The Catalan political parties will be holding meetings with their leaders today.\nOther pro-independence leaders convicted in the Supreme Court ruling have also started to react via social media. The leader of civic society \u00d2mnium Cultural, Jordi Cuixart \u2013 sentenced to nine years in prison and a nine-year ban on holding public office \u2013 has called for \u201crecidivism\u201d as a response to the sentence. \u201cWe will do it again. Amnesty, democracy and self-determination,\u201d he wrote via Twitter from the Lledoners prison in Barcelona. \u00d2mnium Cultural has announced a special meeting today for its members.\nFormer regional minister Josep Rull stated today that the Supreme Court had judged the defendants for their ideas and not the facts. \u201cIf they had judged us on the facts, they would have acquitted us,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGiven that they have judged our ideas, they have convicted us. By convicting us, they have convicted the 2.5 million Catalans who voted on [October 1, 2017] in one of the most extraordinary exercises in democracy seen by Europe in the 21st century.\u201d\nIf they had judged us on the facts, they would have acquitted us\nFormer regional minister Josep Rull\nThe regional premier at the time of the 2017 independence drive, Carles Puigdemont, strongly criticized the sentences in the ruling. The politician, who fled to Belgium in the wake of the events in October 2017 to avoid arrest and trial, said: \u201cIt\u2019s time to react. A total of 100 years in prison. It\u2019s outrageous. Now more than ever, by your side and by your family\u2019s side. It\u2019s time to react, like never before. For the future of your sons and daughters. For democracy. For Europe. For Catalonia,\u201d he said.\nThe former speaker in the Catalan regional parliament, Carme Forcadell \u2013 given eleven-and-a-half years in prison \u2013 called the ruling a \u201cdark day\u201d for democracy. \u201cFree parliamentary debate is not a crime, it\u2019s our right to engage in it and an obligation to defend it. We will never be tired of saying this wherever we need to.\u201d\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/14/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
