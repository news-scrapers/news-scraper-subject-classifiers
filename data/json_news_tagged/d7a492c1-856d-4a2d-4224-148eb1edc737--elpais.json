Under the system, the government estimates how much more money will flow into public coffers, and it gives regions an advance until the predictions are confirmed.\nSpain\u2019s financial authorities are now warning that the situation could get worse in November if there is still no central government by then. The country held an early general election on April 28, partly due to acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s inability to get his budget blueprint approved by parliament.\nS\u00e1nchez, who heads the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE), won the election but fell short of a majority, and he has so far been unable to attract enough political support to form a new government. If no deal emerges by September 23, parliament will be dissolved and a new election called for November \u2013 the fourth in four years.\nOn Friday of last week, S\u00e1nchez said he will offer a \u201cprogressive program\u201d to the leftist Unidas Podemos, the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) and the small Regionalist Party of Cantabria (PRC) in the hopes that they will support his second bid to form a government after failing in his first attempt in July.\nCatalonia has announced new spending cuts across the board, except for essential services and government workers\u2019 salaries, said regional government sources. In the Valencia region, which had been expecting around \u20ac450 million, authorities will cut back on funds that have not yet been allocated. Andalusian leaders have denied that there will be any cuts to meet deficit targets, but 75% of the regional budget depends on financial transfers from Madrid.\nOther regional leaders have admitted that they will have to consider cuts if the political deadlock persists; only Navarre and the Basque Country, which have a different financing system, are being spared the effects of the blocked budget.\nSpain\u2019s acting finance minister, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Montero, has told the SER radio station that she has a report by the Solicitor General\u2019s Office backing the use of a decree to release \u20ac5 billion as an advance as soon as a new government is in place. But \u201cthis cannot be done by an acting government, because it would condition the next executive\u2019s scope for action.\u201d\nA new budget would also let central authorities release a further \u20ac2.5 billion thanks to a change in VAT accounting regulations, but again, this cannot be done by an interim administration. Montero has denied that the PSOE is using this to pressure other parties into facilitating a new government. \u201cWe are not using this to tighten the screws,\u201d she said.\nIf cross-party talks fail and there is no government by November, Montero said that she will do everything possible to find a solution to help the cash-strapped regions. A few days ago, S\u00e1nchez made a pledge to seek a new financing model for Spain\u2019s regions within his first year in office if he is allowed to form a government.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/13/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
