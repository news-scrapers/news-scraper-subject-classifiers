The country has been under a caretaker administration ever since then, as PSOE leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez was unable to secure enough parliamentary support to form a government.\nThe left-leaning Podemos, which currently has 42 representatives in the 350-seat house, would slide down to 31 with 12.4% of the vote, while the newly formed splinter party M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds (More Country), which is headed by former Podemos official I\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n, would secure five seats according to the poll.\nEven a hypothetical alliance of these three groups would still be insufficient for a governing majority. This would force S\u00e1nchez to seek support from other parties in order to get himself confirmed as the prime minister of Spain at an investiture vote to be held after the election. This support would have to come from regional parties; alternatively, the conservative Popular Party (PP) could choose to abstain in a second round of the investiture vote, but party leaders have already ruled out this option.\nMeanwhile, the poll suggests that the political right will benefit from the new election, with the combination of the PP, center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) and the far-right Vox falling four seats short of the leftist bloc.\nCiudadanos seems set to become the big loser on election day, earning just 14 seats compared with its current 57 (8.3% of votes), but this loss would be compensated by a strong performance by the PP, which would jump from 66 to 91 seats (21.2%), making them the second-largest political force in Spain\u2019s lower house of parliament, Congress. And Vox, which is surging in voting intention, could earn as many as 46 seats with 13.7% of the vote, putting it in third place.\nSpain\u2019s fractured politics could be further divided by the fact that two new parties are in the running this time around. In addition to M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds, which could earn as many as five seats, the far-left Catalan separatist party CUP is also running in a national election for the first time, and the poll shows that it could secure two seats inside Congress.\nThe survey polled 2,002 people between October 23 and 29, after the Supreme Court released its decision on the leaders of the failed secession bid, which was followed by weeklong disturbances in Catalonia. Another salient event was the exhumation of the late dictator Francisco Franco from the Valley of the Fallen on October 24.\nAfter four years of political instability, Spaniards are not optimistic about this coming election. Over half of respondents (52.2%) think that it will produce a weak government and that there will eventually be early elections again. Another 23.8% feel that parties will manage a deal to guarantee government stability, while 24% are forecasting no agreement whatsoever and a new repeat election instead.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/04/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
