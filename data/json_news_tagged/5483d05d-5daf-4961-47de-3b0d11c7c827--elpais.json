Two former premiers of Andalusia, which the PSOE governed for 36 years, were found guilty and one of them was sentenced to six years in prison. A total of 19 people have been convicted of corruption-related crimes.\nIs corruption intolerable only if it is other people\u2019s corruption?\nIn\u00e9s Arrimadas, Ciudadanos\nNow, the conservative Popular Party (PP) and the center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) are demanding \u201cpolitical accountability\u201d from S\u00e1nchez. They have also reminded the Socialist leader that he first came to power in mid-2018 on the back of a no-confidence vote against then-PM Mariano Rajoy of the PP, right after a court ruling on another major corruption scandal known as G\u00fcrtel.\n\u201cS\u00e1nchez came to power by unjustly censoring an honest government. Now he must be consistent and accept responsibility for the biggest corruption case in Spanish history, one that has convicted two ex-leaders of the PSOE and of the federation that made him secretary-general,\u201d tweeted PP leader Pablo Casado.\nThe current Andalusian premier, Juan Manuel Moreno Bonilla, who has been heading a PP-Ciudadanos coalition in Spain\u2019s most populous region since January, held up his own executive as a \u201cbreak with the days of corruption, misuse of public funds, wastefulness, cronyism and shamelessness.\u201d\nIn\u00e9s Arrimadas, the likeliest candidate to replace Albert Rivera at the helm of Ciudadanos following the party\u2019s debacle on November 10, has called the ruling \u201cdevastating\u201d for the PSOE, and wants someone to take responsibility. \u201cOr is corruption intolerable only if it is other people\u2019s corruption?\u201d she asked.\nCriticism has also come from the left of the political spectrum. \u201cThe two-party system brought with it corruption and arrogance,\u201d said Pablo Iglesias, leader of the anti-austerity Unidas Podemos, which has reached a preliminary deal with S\u00e1nchez for a coalition government in Spain, although the plan still requires backing from other parliamentary groups.\n\u201cSpain has changed and it will no longer tolerate corruption. An opportunity is opening up now to defend social justice and to guarantee the cleanup of the institutions,\u201d tweeted Iglesias.\nSantiago Abascal, leader of the far-right party Vox, which first entered Spain\u2019s parliamentary institutions at the Andalusian election of December 2018, took aim at the PSOE, Podemos and the Catalan separatist parties whose support may be instrumental in helping S\u00e1nchez form a government.\n\u201cWith help from separatist coupmongers, a government is taking shape that is formed by totalitarian communism and by a socialism that created the biggest corruption web in Europe,\u201d said Abascal, whose party has become the third-largest force in Spanish Congress following the November 10 election.\nThe PSOE\u2019s priority on Tuesday was to protect S\u00e1nchez from the verbal attacks and the calls for his resignation.\nThe party is arguing in its own defense that the ERE ruling \u201caffects neither the current government nor the current party leadership,\u201d in the words of the party\u2019s organization secretary Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, who also serves as public works minister in the current caretaker administration.\nSpain has changed and it will no longer tolerate corruption\nPablo Iglesias, Unidas Podemos\nThe PSOE is also underscoring that there is no evidence of illegal party financing, or of personal gain by any of the guilty parties, in contrast to the G\u00fcrtel case affecting the PP.\n\u201cThere were no Swiss accounts here,\u201d said \u00c1balos at a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cThis case has been constantly and abusively used by the PP to draw attention away from that party\u2019s own structural and systemic corruption.\u201d\nIn a bid to create a firewall between the PSOE and the ERE case, \u00c1balos argued that the party itself was never a target of the investigation, \u201cand so this is not a case [involving] the PSOE, but former public officials of the Andalusian government.\u201d\nHours later, \u00c1balos admitted that the ruling had been \u201cvery tough\u201d and that neither the government nor the PSOE leadership \u201ccan remain indifferent.\u201d\nIn their decision, the three judges at the Seville Provincial Court wrote that all the convicted parties, including former premiers Chaves and Gri\u00f1\u00e1n, \u201cwere fully aware of the manifestly illegal nature of the acts that they were participating in.\u201d\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/20/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
