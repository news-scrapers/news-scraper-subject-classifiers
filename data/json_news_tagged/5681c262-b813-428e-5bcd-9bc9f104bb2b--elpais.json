Barcelona\u2019s High Court sentenced the defendants to between 10 and 12 years in prison for sexual abuse of a minor and the crime of continuous sexual abuse of a minor. The public prosecutor had called for the defendants to be charged for the more serious crime of sexual assault, but the court ruled that the victim was in an \u201cunconscious state,\u201d meaning that the men did not need to use violence and intimidation against her \u2013 which is a prerequisite for a rape charge under Spanish law.\nThe men have been dubbed \u201cLa Manada de Manresa,\u201d after the similarities to the high-profile Running of the Bulls rape trial\nOn October 29, 2016, the defendants took turns raping the 14-year-old victim during an outdoor drinking session \u2013 known in Spanish as a botell\u00f3n \u2013 in an abandoned factory in Torre d\u2019en Vinyes, a small town in Manresa. The victim testified in July that she remembered only part of what happened that night, but said that the main defendant, Bryan Andr\u00e9s, told his friends they had \u201c15 minutes each\u201d to rape her. She explained that he forced her to have sex while brandishing a gun.\nThe court, however, ruled that the victim, who had consumed alcohol and drugs on the night in question, did \u201cnot know what she was and wasn\u2019t doing, and consequently, did not have the ability to agree to or oppose the sexual relations most of the defendants had with her,\u201d adding that the defendants \u201cwere able to commit sexual acts without using any type of violence or intimidation.\u201d\nThe court sentenced two of the accused to a longer prison sentence of 12 years in jail, ruling that they were guilty of the additional crime of continuous sexual abuse. Two of the defendants were cleared of sexual abuse. In one case, the court found that there was not enough evidence that the defendant had committed the crime. In the second case, which concerned a man who masturbated while the victim was being raped, the court ruled that the offense of failing to stop a crime had not been proven.\nThe court ruled the defendants \u201cwere able to commit sexual acts without using any type of violence or intimidation\u201d\nThe court has awarded the victim \u20ac12,000 in damages, ruling that \u201cthe attack on the victim\u2019s sexual integrity was extremely severe and especially denigrating, and what\u2019s more, was against a minor in a situation of distress.\u201d\nThe men have been dubbed \u201cLa Manada de Manresa,\u201d or the Wolf Pack of Manresa, given the similarities of the case to the high-profile La Manada rape trial, where five men were found guilty of gang-raping an 18-year-old woman at the 2016 Running of the Bull fiestas in Pamplona. In 2018, a court in Navarre sentenced the five men to sexual abuse, claiming violence and intimidation were not used against the victim. Spain\u2019s Supreme Court overturned the sentence this year, ruling that the defendants were guilty of rape. The judges increased the prison sentence to 15 years.\nThe initial verdict in the Running of the Bulls case caused widespread protests and pushed the then-Popular Party (PP) government to create a commission to revise the definition of sexual violence in the criminal code. In December 2018, the commission sent its recommendations to the government, by that time run by the Socialist Party (PSOE). They included getting rid of the term sexual abuse and defining all crimes against sexual freedom as sexual assault. The PSOE administration \u2013 which has been a caretaker government since the inconclusive general election of April 28 this year \u2013 has still not acted on these reforms.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/31/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
