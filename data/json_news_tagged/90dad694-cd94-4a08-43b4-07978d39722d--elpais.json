But after the final count of votes, including those of so-called \u201cabsent residents,\u201d it turns out they won in the province of Bizkaia, bringing their new total in Congress to 89, and complicating yet further caretaker Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s bid to be voted back in to office.\nBarring any legal challenges to the result, Beatriz Fanjul will become the 89th PP deputy in the Congress of Deputies for the upcoming political term. Until today, the seat belonged to the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), which was the most-voted group in the northern Basque Country region with seven deputies, and 32% of the votes cast.\nS\u00e1nchez will require the abstention of the Catalan Republican Left, and Bildu, a Basque nationalist party\nAs at the April general election, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialist Party (PSOE) won the most seats at Sunday\u2019s poll, but fell short of an absolute majority. On Monday, S\u00e1nchez and left-wing Unidas Podemos announced a pre-agreement for a coalition deal. Even with the sum of the two groups\u2019 seats \u2013 155 \u2013 they are still short of the 176 needed for an absolute majority.\nThe PNV is likely to support the PSOE-Unidas Podemos deal, but will now have only six seats in Congress rather than seven. Along with the likely support of other smaller parties, S\u00e1nchez would have 167 votes at the first round of an investiture debate \u2013 nine short of the majority.\nAt the second round of voting, however, just a simple majority is needed \u2013 more yes votes than no. This would mean, given that groups such as the PP, Ciudadanos (Citizens) and far-right Vox will vote against, that S\u00e1nchez will require the abstention of the Catalan Republican Left (ERC), which won 13 seats, and Bildu, a Basque nationalist party that took five seats.\nFor now the Canarian Coalition is opting not to support S\u00e1nchez. But if it changes its mind and opts to vote yes, S\u00e1nchez would count on 169 votes and would need 13 abstentions \u2013 exactly the number of seats that ERC has.\nMeanwhile, the PSOE is planning on consulting its members on the coalition agreement it is drawing up with Unidas Podemos, which is likely to include handing over a number of ministries to the left-wing party as well as giving one of the several deputy prime ministerial roles to its leader, Pablo Iglesias.\nThe party is also starting talks with the other parties that are likely to support S\u00e1nchez at an investiture vote \u2013 many of them the same that supported the caretaker prime minister when he tabled a successful vote of no confidence against then-PP Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy last summer, after the latter\u2019s party was yet again mired in a corruption scandal.\nThe ERC is likely to be the biggest obstacle for S\u00e1nchez, given the tensions surrounding the ongoing independence drive in Catalonia. A recent Supreme Court ruling on the events of the fall of 2017 \u2013 which saw an illegal referendum on secession held in the region, followed by a unilateral declaration of independence \u2013 jailed nine politicians and civic leaders, prompting widespread demonstrations and protests, some of them violent. The ERC has already stated that it wants to discuss self-determination for Catalonia and deal with the issue of what it describes as the \u201cpolitical prisoners.\u201d\nFor its part, far-right Vox \u2013 which picked up 52 seats at Sunday\u2019s election, up from the 24 it won in April \u2013 today added its voice to the PP and Ciudadanos\u2019 criticism of the PSOE-Unidas Podemos coalition deal announced yesterday. The leader of Vox, Santiago Abascal, accused Pedro S\u00e1nchez of being \u201cdishonest and ambitious\u201d and of having \u201cconned Spaniards\u201d for having gone back on his word that such a coalition would not become a reality.\nAbascal went so far as to say that the caretaker government had sent the Spanish royal family on its first official visit to Cuba this week so that they can start to \u201cacclimatize\u201d themselves to what life could be like from now on in Spain.\nAt his first press conference in Congress since the general elections on Sunday, Abascal also claimed that he had direct evidence that the PSOE government had given the Civil Guard orders to withdraw from the freeways that were blocked this week by pro-Catalan independence protestors on the French border, and to not take action against the picket lines. Vox claims that the PSOE-Unidas Podemos deal will favor \u201cinstitutional disorder\u201d in the northeastern Spanish region.\nAbascal also claimed that the PSOE-Unidas Podemos deal would mean \u201cthe destruction of the middle classes and the working classes, of the social harmony of Spaniards and the weakening of borders, of safety in the streets, and the delegitimizing of the monarchy.\u201d\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/13/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
