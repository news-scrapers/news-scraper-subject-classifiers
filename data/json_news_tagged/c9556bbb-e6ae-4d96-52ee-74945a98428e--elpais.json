In 2007, when their son Jordi was separating from his wife, Ram\u00f3n and Margarita went to a court in Catalonia to fight their former daughter-in-law for the right to visit their two granddaughters. The court ruled in their favor, and ordered that they be allowed to see the two girls at least once every two weeks.\nThe money does not compensate for all that we have lost\nRam\u00f3n, grandparent\nBut the mother refused to follow the court order and for years, the grandparents were unable to see their grandchildren. \u201cWe traveled 200 kilometers to see them, we knocked on the door and [the daughter-in-law] never let us in,\u201d says Ram\u00f3n, who lives with his wife in a small municipality in the northeastern city of Tarragona.\nAs the years passed, the couple wrote numerous times to the judge in charge of the case to say they were not being allowed to see the children. But nothing was done.\nNow in a pioneering sentence, Spain\u2019s High Court, the Audencia Nacional, has ordered the Justice Ministry to pay Ram\u00f3n and Margarita \u20ac25,000 each, plus interest, in compensation for the judge\u2019s inaction and the lengthy legal process.\n\u201cThe money does not compensate for all that we have lost, so many court cases and we were not able to be with [the granddaughters] or see them grow up,\u201d says Ram\u00f3n, who like his wife, has not seen his grandchildren for 14 years. The couple has lost all hope that things will change. One of the girls is now 18 years old and the other is 16.\n\u201cThey have robbed us of a life with our granddaughters. When we look at each other, we know that we are without them,\u201d says Ram\u00f3n.\nWe are 76 years old and we would like to be with them before we die\nRam\u00f3n, grandparent\nThe mother also stopped the father from seeing the children. After the divorce, she reported Jordi for allegedly abusing one of their daughters. A judge issued a restraining order against him and began criminal proceedings. Jordi was acquitted eight years\u00a0later by Tarragona\u2019s High Court, which described the mother\u2019s complaint as \u201cseriously disturbing.\u201d\nDuring that eight-year period, Jordi was unable to see his daughters, and when a judge finally allowed him to, the girls did not want to see him. The mother meanwhile continued to put up obstacles to stop him and his grandparents from visiting the girls. As the girls grew up, they refused to see both their father or grandparents.\n\u201cWhat good does it do now that the justice system has ruled in our favor if the court order was never met?\u201d asks Ram\u00f3n angrily.\nRam\u00f3n and Margarita initially asked for \u20ac200,000 in compensation for psychological damage over the court\u2019s inaction. But the Justice Ministry only agreed to pay \u20ac20,000 \u2013 \u20ac10,000 each. Ram\u00f3n and Margarita appealed the ministry\u2019s offer at the High Court, which ruled that they be given \u20ac25,000 each for the \u201cundue delays of the judge\u201d in enforcing his own sentence.\n\u201cThey have grown up and we still know nothing about them. The Justice Ministry has been very slow\u2026 Years have passed and there has been a lot of suffering. We are 76 years old and we would like to be with them before we die. But time has passed and I fear we will die without that pleasure,\u201d says Ram\u00f3n.\nAs for the compensation, Jordi says it is far from enough. \u201cWe have spent more on lawyers,\u201d he says. Jordi is,\u00a0however, hopeful that he will be able to reconnect with his daughters in the future: \u201cI think after some years have passed, my daughters will be able to think for themselves, without being influenced, then I will be able to speak with them and tell them everything.\u201d\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/04/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
