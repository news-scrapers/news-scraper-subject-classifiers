In his latest film, Rambo: Last Blood, the Vietnam veteran embarks on a killing spree as he battles the Mart\u00ednez brothers\u2019 Mexican drug cartel. The brothers are, of course, psychopathic, bloodthirsty and one-dimensional as could be expected of a movie that has been dubbed \u201ca Trumpian fantasy,\u201d in reference to US President Donald Trump. All in all, the movie is an ode to white justice triumphing over Latino evil and executed beyond the boundaries of the law, with the requisite fallout of untold death and destruction.\nBut \u00d3scar Jaenada and Sergio Peris-Mencheta, who play the Mart\u00ednez brothers, are not in fact from the Mexican towns of Tijuana or Monterrey, but from the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Madrid, respectively. They are the most recent in a long line of actors who have crossed the Atlantic from Spain in order to play the Latin American villain in Hollywood. First we had the Nazis, then the Russian communists and the jihadists; now we have the Latin American drug lords with a Spanish face.\nThe dialogue and imagery of cartel movies associates Latino identity with inherent, pure evil again and again\nH\u00e9ctor Tobar, journalist\nThe international success of Narcos, the series that ushered Pablo Escobar into the mainstream of popular culture, has inspired the US entertainment industry to explore the narcotics underworld. Spanish actors such as Miguel \u00c1ngel Silvestre, Javier C\u00e1mara and Alberto Ammann (who is Spanish-Argentine) have had to work hard on their accent in order to join the ranks of those signing up to the clich\u00e9.\nJavier Bardem has done so twice: in Collateral, which was one of his first Hollywood movies, and in Loving Pablo, the most recent portrayal of the head of the Medell\u00edn cartel, with Jaenada also in the cast.\nJaenada\u2019s brother in Rambo: Last Blood, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, is currently playing a Mexican-American narco in the series Snowfall, which depicts the 1980s crack epidemic in Los Angeles. Then there is Carlos Bardem, who also contributed to the collection of Escobar films in Paradise Lost. When it comes to this model, the road has been traveled by a wide range of Spanish actors, from the reluctant Luis Tosar (Miami Vice) to Jordi Moll\u00e0, who played a drug lord in Blow, Bad Boys II and Colombiana.\nDubbed \u201cthe new Westerns\u201d by Oscar-winner Benicio del Toro, the narco genre has become an unprecedented way into Hollywood for Spanish-speaking actors at the cost of playing what amounts to a caricature. \u201cEvery time I see one of these actors in one of these roles, it strikes me as a pretty ridiculous use of the character,\u201d says film critic Jordi Costa, who believes that these jobs don\u2019t do credit to the talents of those taking them.\nOf course, for a Spanish actor, it is almost impossible to refuse such roles; their work will get international exposure and the jobs are well paid. Also to be considered is the increasing precariousness of the Spanish film industry, even for its most successful actors. According to Peris-Mencheta, for example, the income he receives from such roles in the US allows him to pursue his theater projects back home without having to depend on state subsidies or the criteria of the theater itself.\nBut the risk of becoming typecast is high. \u201cIf I consider Jordi Moll\u00e0\u2019s US career, that is the clich\u00e9 that comes to mind. He will have to figure out for himself how far it works in his favor or is profitable, but it\u2019s clearly a stereotype,\u201d notes Costa.\nOnly the studio bosses themselves can say why they pick Spanish actors to play the roles of Latin American narcos, but it does suggest an element of whitewashing \u2013 the practice of giving white actors preferential treatment in auditions.\nIn recent years, while ethnic minorities have complained about whitewashing, the studios have justified their choices by indicating sales at the box office. Stars such as Scarlett Johansson (Ghost in the Shell) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Prince of Persia) have been criticized for taking roles that should have been given to actors of, in Gyllenhaal\u2019s case, Iranian origin and in Johansson\u2019s case, Asian origin. Responding to the criticism, Gyllenhaal said he wasn\u2019t able to go back in time to make a different decision.\nBut not all Spanish-speaking actors have gone down the narco route. The clip of Argentina\u2019s Ricardo Dar\u00edn turning his back on Hollywood money and glamour during a television interview in 2013 went viral.\n\u201cThey offered me the role of a Mexican drug trafficker [in The Fire of Vengeance] and I didn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cAre all drug traffickers Latin Americans? Given that the United States is the country with the highest consumption of drugs on the face of the Earth\u2026 I didn\u2019t like it,\u201d he said.\nDirected by Tony Scott and starring Denzel Washington, the film ended up casting the US singer Marc Anthony, who has Puerto Rican heritage. At 62, Dar\u00edn has still not starred in a Hollywood film.\nMeanwhile, Moulin Rouge star John Leguizamo, who was born in Colombia and is now one of Hollywood\u2019s most prolific actors, has also side-stepped the stereotype. \u201cI don\u2019t want to play a drug trafficker or a killer for the rest of my life. It\u2019s not me and those are not my people,\u201d he said at the 2015 Sundance Festival.\nJonathan Jakubowicz, the Venezuelan director of Hands of Stone about the Panamanian boxer Roberto Dur\u00e1n, shared an anecdote that accurately illustrates the current trend. \u201cWhen the movie premiered, I asked a number of friends who run film studios if they could tell me of any other movie where the Latino star wasn\u2019t a criminal and, honestly, none of them were able to give me an answer.\u201d\nIn the Trump era, the stereotype has political and social repercussions that are impossible to ignore. Almost every critic reviewing Rambo: Last Blood described it as pure propaganda for Trump\u2019s border wall between the US and Mexico.\nAbundant data highlights the fact that, within the US entertainment industry, Latin Americans are most frequently cast as working in the drug trade, either as a kingpin, a hit man or a small-time dealer. According to research carried out by the University of Southern California, 25% of Latin Americans are portrayed as criminals and 17% as poverty-stricken or low-income characters.\n\u201cEven worse, when we are portrayed, too often we\u2019re presented as criminals and narcos,\u201d wrote the Mexican-born director Gregory Nava, who was nominated for an Oscar for The North, in an opinion piece for the Los Angeles Times.\nIn the Trump era, the stereotype has political and social repercussions that are impossible to ignore\nTaking into account the minimal number of Latin Americans in starring roles in the past \u2013 a mere 3% despite accounting for a quarter of the US audience \u2013 the stereotype plays nicely into the hands of xenophobes.\n\u201cThe dialogue and imagery of cartel movies associates Latino identity with inherent, pure evil again and again. It\u2019s time for Hollywood to ask: What message are we sending to the American public by asking this country\u2019s Latino actors to act out one execution-style killing after another? \u201d writes the journalist H\u00e9ctor Tobar in The New York Times.\n\u201cBy choosing to glorify these particular stories on-screen, not only are we sending a terrible message to young Latinos, we\u2019re also reinforcing stereotypes that have typecast Latinos as criminals for decades on TV,\u201d wrote the journalist Patricia Garc\u00eda in an article for Vogue.\nBut Spain\u2019s Jordi Costa is not optimistic. \u201cOnly when Latin American directors get a foot in the door of Hollywood, make their own storylines and listen to their own communities, will [the stereotypes] be questioned. But I imagine it will be a while before we are free of them.\u201d\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/08/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
