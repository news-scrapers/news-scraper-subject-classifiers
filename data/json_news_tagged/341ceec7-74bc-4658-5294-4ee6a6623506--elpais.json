Two years later, Lorena was not allowed to board when an airline refused to accept her medical certificate which said she could fly even though she was heavily pregnant. Both names are fictitious but their stories are not. Just like shops and restaurants, airlines also have the right to refuse admission. But while passengers accept the conditions of each carrier by default, few understand what these involve. For example, a passenger who is drunk or behaving offensively can be kicked off a flight without being compensated, although they can file a complaint later.\n\u201cThese are contracts where the consumer has no negotiating power,\u201d explains Miguel \u00c1ngel Serrano, from the legal team of the consumer rights association FACUA. Last week, FACUA filed a complaint against Spanish low-cost airline Vueling for refusing to allow a 24-year-old woman from Granada to board the plane. Laura C. was grounded for wearing what Vueling workers considered to be inappropriate clothing \u2013 Laura C. described the outfit as a bodysuit, a one-piece form-fitting garment, but the airplane said it was a swimsuit and asked her to cover up. What happened next made the news: passengers tried to defend the woman and the heated argument was recorded on a video that went viral on social media.\nHoy la maravillosa compa\u00f1\u00eda @vueling le ha prohibido el embarque a mi hermana simplemente por llevar un body escotado. Varias personas le han dejado ropa para que se \u201ctapase\u201d y aun as\u00ed no la han dejado subir. pic.twitter.com/wxiYguA4qt\nToday the marvelous company Vueling stopped my sister from boarding simply for wearing a bodysuit. Several people gave her clothes so she could \u201ccover herself\u201d and they still did not let her get on.\n\u201cAirline conditions cannot go against regulations, nor does the company have the authority to decide how a person can dress, as long as they are respecting the public order,\u201d argues Serrano.\nVueling, however, insists that the issue was not what Laura C. was wearing but the fact that she responded \u201crudely\u201d to airline staff and \u201cthe situation became extreme.\u201d In other words, it was a potential risk to the security of passengers and crew.\nUnder EU regulations, an airline does not have to compensate a passenger who has been refused on board if they had \u201creasonable motives\u201d \u2013 either the passenger represented a security risk, did not have valid travel documents, or for health concerns.\n\u201cRegulations consider overbooking, where there are more passengers than seats, as grounds for refusal, but everything else is company policy,\u201d says Almudena Vel\u00e1zquez, a lawyer for the platform Reclamador.\nThese are contracts where the consumer has no negotiating power\nMiguel \u00c1ngel Serrano, FACUA\nAccording to these conditions, the aircraft commander, the top authority in these situations, has the power to divert a flight if a passenger is considered troublesome or dangerous. \u201cBroadly speaking, admission can be denied if a passenger is considered to be behaving inappropriately, but these are generic conditions that can be misinterpreted,\u201d explains Leonor Amador de los R\u00edos from the law firm Jur\u00eddica A\u00e9rea.\nLow-cost airline Ryanair reserves the right to turn away passengers who have smoked or who have tried to smoke on previous flights (their names are placed on a kind of black list), or who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, while Dutch air carrier KLM and the Spanish airline Iberia can refuse people who have consumed medication that could cause \u201cdiscomfort, danger or risk to themselves, other passengers, the crew, and goods.\u201d EasyJet does not allow passengers who make bomb threats on board and, like Ryanair, reserves the right to cancel their future flights.\nLaura C. has filed a complaint against Vueling and announced she will also report the air carrier to the consumer watchdog in the Balearic Islands, where she was meant to catch her flight. If a passenger wants to claim damages \u2013 not just the refunded money \u2013 they have to file a request with an arbitrator or start court proceedings, says Vel\u00e1zquez. But according to Amador de los R\u00edos, many people give up when denied compensation. In the case of Laura C., it is too early to know what will happen. \u201cThe good thing is that [the case] has become known because of social media,\u201d says Vel\u00e1zquez. \u201cCompanies have to realize that they must act logically and respectfully towards the consumer.\u201d\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "07/30/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
