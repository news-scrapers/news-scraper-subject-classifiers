S\u00e1nchez\u2019s bid to form a government after April failed to attract enough congressional backing, and Spain has been run by a caretaker government since then.\nThe ERC, whose leader Oriol Junqueras was recently sentenced to 13 years in prison for sedition and misuse of public funds in connection with the 2017 secession attempt, is demanding a change in the Socialist leader\u2019s rhetoric about Catalonia, and the creation of a committee outside of parliament in exchange for its support.\nS\u00e1nchez had toughened up his Catalonia talk in the last few days of the election campaign in a bid to compete with the right for undecided voters. Shortly before the election he said he supported reintroducing criminal penalties for calling illegal referendums. But now he is talking about \u201ca political crisis\u201d and \u201ca territorial crisis,\u201d rather than \u201ca crisis of coexistence.\u201d The ERC had publicly asked the PSOE leader to admit that the crisis in Catalonia is political.\nNow, S\u00e1nchez is trying to convince ERC\u2019s 13 lawmakers in Congress that if they don\u2019t help create a center-left government with their abstention at the investiture vote, there could be a third general election in Spain in the space of a year, one that might deliver even bigger gains to the far right, which has more than doubled its congressional presence from April. \u201cOtherwise, what solution do you propose? What kind of government do you want?\u201d he said.\nSo far, ERC leaders have said they plan to vote no, adding that they remain open to further talks.\nBesides the ERC, S\u00e1nchez also needs to court several smaller regional parties, including the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) \u2013 which just lost one seat to the conservative Popular Party (PP) in the most recent vote count \u2013 the Canaries Coalition (CC) and the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG). He will also need an abstention from the Basque Country party Bildu, a radical nationalist leftist group.\nIN\u00c9S SANTAEULALIA, Madrid\nCaretaker Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has said he is very excited about the preliminary agreement he has struck with Pablo Iglesias of Unidas Podemos, who stands to become the new deputy prime minister of Spain in a coalition government.\nUntil recently, S\u00e1nchez had been underscoring the tremendous difference in the way that the PSOE and Unidas Podemos viewed the Catalan crisis. The latter had defended the region\u2019s right to decide in a referendum, while the former rejected such a vote as unconstitutional.\nIglesias, who had not made any statements since the deal was announced on Tuesday, has sent a letter to supporters warning them that their views will be in the minority in a PSOE-led executive, and that \u201cwe will have to yield on many issues.\u201d\nBesides Catalonia, both parties have diverging views on the economy. Iglesias has warned party members that Podemos will have to give up on part of its program. \u201cRemember that heaven is won through perseverance,\u201d he has warned.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/15/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
