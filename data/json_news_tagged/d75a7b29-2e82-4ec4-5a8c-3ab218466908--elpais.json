He was found guilty by the Spanish courts of tax fraud, embezzlement and influence peddling, and entered prison on June 18, 2018.\nUrdangarin\u2019s visit to the Hogar Don Orione center on Thursday marks the first time the former Olympic handball medalist has left the prison since that date. He was taken out of the penitentiary at 8.58am by car, and arrived at the Hogar Don Orione center at 9.58am. Dressed in a long-sleeved shirt, blue pants and sneakers, he waved but made no comment before entering the facility.\nOnce inside, Urdangarin met with the director of Hogar Don Orione, Paco S\u00e1nchez, who will decide what jobs the king\u2019s brother-in-law will be assigned. The center looks after 140 adults with severe intellectual disabilities. There are 100 professionals working there and 40 volunteers, some of whom are also prison inmates, according to sources from Hogar Don Orione.\nS\u00e1nchez said that Urdangarin will begin his volunteer work by aiding the teams that help improve the mobility of the center\u2019s members with physiotherapy, as well as psychomotor and sports therapies. He will then be able to take a break for a \u201csandwich or his lunchbox, if he brings one,\u201d S\u00e1nchez added. Urdangarin will spend between five and six hours a day at the center and will be free to move about the facility. \u201cThe center is open, there is freedom of movement, but it is normally the members who receive visitors, not the volunteers,\u201d said the director, who described Urdangarin as \u201cgrateful and cooperative\u201d and \u201ccalm and happy.\u201d At midday, S\u00e1nchez gave Urdangarin a tour of the center and handed him a volunteer kit, which included a shirt and ID. He will work at the center twice a week and return to prison before 5pm.\nThe head of the center described Urdangarin as \u201cgrateful and cooperative\u201d\nUrdangarin was granted permission to work as a volunteer on Tuesday by Judge Florencio de Marcos at the Castile and Le\u00f3n Prison Supervision Court. The decision was made against the advice of prison authorities and the public prosecutor, who consider the king\u2019s brother-in-law to be at \u201cmedium-high\u201d risk of re-offending. In his court statement, the judge defended his decision on the basis that Urdangarin is serving his sentence in isolation. The king\u2019s brother-in-law is the only inmate in the \u201cmen\u2019s unit\u201d of the Brieva women\u2019s penitentiary, meaning that he has no contact with other prisoners and his social life is restricted to visits from his family. Spanish prison authorities could have transferred the high-profile inmate to another prison, but decided to allow him to stay for security reasons.\nIn the unusually long 22-page court statement, Judge De Marcos argued that Urdangarin did not choose to serve his sentence in isolation, but rather that it was a decision taken by prison authorities, adding that working \u201cwithout economic or material compensation\u201d is a way of fostering \u201cpro-social values.\u201d\n\u201cIn the context of economic crime, which revolves around selfishness, the excessive thirst for profit and disregard of the common interest, having contact with real life, with the problems of others, helps create meaningful awareness about that criminal behavior,\u201d the judge wrote in his statement.\nUrdangarin and his ex-business associate, Diego Torres, were the leading figures at the N\u00f3os Institute, a non-profit that secured no-bid contracts from the regional governments of Valencia and the Balearic Islands using Urdangarin\u2019s influence.\nUrdangarin and Torres also used their non-profit to divert around \u20ac6.2 million from public contracts secured for organizing sports events into private accounts. Urdangarin\u2019s wife, Cristina de Borb\u00f3n, sat on the board of a company, Aizoon, that was allegedly used to channel part of these funds. She was made to testify in the case, and was ultimately fined for having benefited from her husband\u2019s scheme, but was acquitted of tax fraud complicity.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/19/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
