G\u00e1dor Joya, a pediatrician and a deputy in the Madrid regional assembly, says she has been providing the free service \u2013 dubbed the \u201cLife Ambulance Project\u201d \u2013 from a van because she believes women \u201cdon\u2019t know what they are carrying inside them\u201d when they get pregnant.\n\u201cI and other doctors have been giving these women ultrasounds\u2026 Precisely because I have been doing this, I know what has been hidden from these women. Most of them, when they receive the information and hear the heartbeat, decide to go forward with their pregnancies,\u201d said Joya at a regional health committee meeting on November 5.\nPrecisely because I have been doing this, I know what has been hidden from these women\nG\u00e1dor Joya, Vox lawmaker\nM\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda, from the leftist M\u00e1s Madrid party, said she could not believe was she was hearing. Garc\u00eda, who was present at the meeting, asked Madrid deputy health chief Ana D\u00e1vila-Ponce de Le\u00f3n, from the conservative Popular Party (PP), if health centers in the Madrid region were hiding information from pregnant women or stopping them from having ultrasounds. The answer was no. Two days later, Garc\u00eda filed a question with the Madrid regional assembly inquiring whether the health department \u201cauthorizes the use of private motor vehicles to carry out diagnostic ultrasounds on the doorsteps of abortion clinics.\u201d\nThe health department has confirmed that Joya\u2019s vehicle has authorization, but did not specify when this was granted, or why it was allowing a health professional, who is also a public representative, to perform ultrasounds on women inside a van near abortion clinics. The department said this was protected information, and added that Joya was no longer working for the public health system.\nDe lo q m\u00e1s me enorgullezco como m\u00e9dico es de haber ayudado a muchas mujeres a ser madres cuando estaban a punto de abortar. S\u00ed, he trabajado en un proyecto cuyo objetivo es defender el derecho a la vida y la dignidad de todo ser humano. Y lo seguir\u00e9 haciendo all\u00ed donde est\u00e9.\n\u201cWhat I am proudest of as a doctor is having helped many women to become mothers when they were on the point of aborting. Yes, I have worked for a project aimed at defending the right to life and dignity of all human beings. And I will continue doing it wherever I am.\u201d\nGarc\u00eda noted how anti-abortion protesters have been harassing women and doctors for years outside the Dator health clinic, which was the first in Spain to be granted permission to perform abortions. Last September, 62 organizations joined the Pro-Rights Platform to demand that harassing women and health workers in abortion clinics be made a crime. The groups estimate that 8,000 people have been harassed in such circumstances in Spain since 2010, when the country adopted legislation allowing abortion on demand during the first trimester.\n\u201cWhat we could not have imagined is that there would be people performing ultrasounds on the street. It\u2019s extremely serious,\u201d said Garc\u00eda. During the commission, Garc\u00eda asked Joya what her objective was: \u201cTo dissuade [women from having abortions] or to torture them? Because [Joya] says that many women decide not to have an abortion when they hear the heartbeat. How many women is that? And what happens to them? What is the psychological and emotional cost for these women?\u201d\nJoya did not provide any figures to the commission: she did not say how long she had been using the van, how many women she had offered ultrasounds to, nor how many women had subsequently decided not to have a termination. In a promotional video for the Life Ambulance Project, Joya introduces herself as the coordinator. The video also features a psychiatrist, Jes\u00fas Poveda, who is a promoter of the so-called Rescuers School Association, which tries to dissuade women from having an abortion; and a gynecologist, Sonsoles Alonso, who calls the embryo that appears on the screen a \u201cbaby.\u201d The promotional video uses sounds including an increasingly loud heartbeat, and phrases such as \u201cbabies stripped from their mother\u2019s breast\u201d in an effort to criminalize abortion and the professionals who practice it.\nIn Spain, women have had the right to abortions since 1985. But Madrid regional premier Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, of the PP, recently expressed a different take on the issue. \u201cI view an abortion as neither a right nor a crime. It is a failure, because unwanted pregnancies can be avoided,\u201d she said during a parliamentary debate with Roc\u00edo Monasterio, a Madrid regional deputy for Vox.\nA week earlier, the deputy regional health chief, Ana D\u00e1vila Ponce de Le\u00f3n, had provided false data on the number of abortions carried out in the Madrid region, insisting that they had risen by 50% between 2010, when the Socialist Party (PSOE) government of then-Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero introduced first-trimester abortion on demand, and 2018. In reality the figures dropped from 20,946 to 18,914 in this time period \u2013 a fall of 9.7% \u2013 according to the latest data from the national Health Ministry.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/18/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
