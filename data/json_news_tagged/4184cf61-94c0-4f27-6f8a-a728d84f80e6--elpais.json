In 2011 that number was 352.\nThere are huge regional disparities: in Madrid, the super-rich pay nothing in wealth tax\nThe number of citizens who declared property worth more than \u20ac1.5 million grew 35% for a total of 60,337 individuals.\nThe Spanish Tax Agency\u2019s statistics show that the ultra-wealthy have benefited from the economic recovery to a greater extent than other citizens.\nThe levy is controversial, and Spain is one of the few remaining countries that still taxes an individual\u2019s net assets (if these are in excess of \u20ac700,000) on top of income or capital gains. While it is a state levy, it has been devolved to the regions, leading to huge disparities depending on one\u2019s tax residence.\nThe Madrid region, for instance, has a 100% allowance, meaning that its super-rich population has to pay nothing in wealth tax. This deprives the regional government of \u20ac955.6 million a year. Catalonia, which does collect the wealth tax, makes \u20ac498.5 million annually.\nThe tax agency\u2019s statistics for 2015 show that there were 71 people worth more than \u20ac100 million that year\nPart of the reason why the super-rich population has grown so much is the fact that in 2012, the government of Mariano Rajoy, of the Popular Party (PP), introduced a tax amnesty that uncovered \u20ac40 billion that had been going undeclared until then.\nThe following year, the government approved a tax form known as Modelo 720 that forced individuals to declare their international assets or face a stiff fine. This uncovered \u20ac156 billion in assets that Spanish residents were keeping abroad.\nThe tax agency\u2019s statistics for 2015 show that there were 71 people worth more than \u20ac100 million that year, including athletes, artists, business leaders and the heirs of Spain\u2019s wealthiest families.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/04/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
