The CNT got the archives out of Barcelona in April 1939 and, after a long journey with stops in Paris and the British cities of Harrogate and Oxford, they arrived safely at the International Institute of Social History (IIHS) in Amsterdam in 1947.\nThe boxes contain more than 500 negatives of photos taken between 1937 and 1938 by Horna, a Jewish banker\u2019s daughter born in Budapest in 1912, who came to Spain during the Spanish Civil War to offer her services to the CNT anarchists and the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI) in their foreign propaganda department. The extraordinary find completes a series that includes 250 negatives now kept in the Documentation Center of Historical Memory in Salamanca, which was sold by Horna to the Spanish state in 1983 for two million pesetas (around \u20ac12,000 at today\u2019s rates).\nThese 250 negatives had been salvaged by Horna and carried into exile in a small tin box. Her journey out of Spain was made in the company of her partner, the artist Jos\u00e9 Horna, who would be arrested and sent to a concentration camp in France. Once he was freed, the couple fled the Nazi invasion and settled in Mexico, where Horna developed her career as a photographer and surrealist. The whereabouts of the rest of her Civil War photos had remained a mystery until now.\nReferring to their precarious journey to Amsterdam, Henk Wals, the director general of IIHS, explains that the photos were not sent directly to the institute because they feared that the Second World War would reach the Netherlands, despite its neutral status \u2013 and in fact the Nazis did invade in 1940.\nThe IIHS was set up in 1936 to protect collections of archives that were considered at risk from the rise of authoritarian regimes in Europe. \u201cThe catastrophic end of the Spanish Republic was exactly the kind of situation the founders had in mind,\u201d says Wals.\nThe wooden boxes remained locked in the IIHS for more than three decades until the death of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in 1975 allowed the CNT to resurface. The boxes were opened and the material organized with published inventories. Only the CNT-FAI Foreign Propaganda Offices\u2019 photo archives remained. These were set aside, pending classification, which didn\u2019t happen until 2016 when the art historian Almudena Rubio, a researcher at the center, started to organize the copies first and then the negatives.\nRubio is still drawing up the photo inventory from the Spanish Civil War \u2013 more than 6,000 celluloid negatives and more than 200 glass plates, which have emerged in good condition. A comparison with other stocks of photos associated with the war offer some idea of the scale of the discovery; the archive from the Propaganda Delegation of Madrid in the Culture Ministry has 3,051 images while the famous Mexican suitcase found in 2007 and belonging to Robert Capa, Gerda Taro and David Chim Seymour contained 4,500 negatives.\nOn the Culture Ministry\u2019s website, it still says: \u201cA large part of Kati Horna\u2019s photographic series from the Civil War is probably scattered or destroyed.\u201d\nAccording to Rubio, the new negatives are complementary to the Salamanca collection rather than repetitive. \u201cUntil now, [Kati Horna] was recognized as a photographer and artist but she was taken on by the anarchists in 1937,\u201d says Rubio. \u201cShe never worked for the Republic. She worked for the CNT-FAI and you can\u2019t properly understand the photos without taking her political militancy into account.\u201d\nThe discovery offers an insight into the years Horna spent in Spain. Horna has been considered a rearguard portrait photographer who also captured the essence of daily life of women, for instance in her iconic photo of a mother breastfeeding her child in V\u00e9lez Rubio, Almer\u00eda.\nThe breastfeeding photo made the front cover of the 12th edition of the anarchist magazine Umbral and was used to illustrate a report called Maternity under the symbol of the Revolution. Almudena Rubio says that the photo is among the negatives in Salamanca because these types of photo, taken in refugee centers, fitted the requirements of the Umbral publishers.\nThe new images, on the other hand, do not particularly focus on women\u2019s issues. \u201cShe constantly takes portraits of villagers of both sexes and boys and girls. I believe Horna went further \u2013 she was seeking the narrative, the story,\u201d says Rubio, who never considered Horna to be a feminist photographer even before stumbling across the new cache of her work. \u201cThe negatives in Amsterdam don\u2019t reveal a new Horna, although we have found series [of photos] whose existence we were unaware of until now, such as the funerals of the anarchists, [Camillo] Berneri and [Francisco] Barbieri.\u201d\nThe recently discovered negatives cover Horna\u2019s stay in Barcelona from her arrival at the age of 24 in January, 1937, until her move to Valencia in July. She was not a professional photographer, although she had received some training. However, she became the official reporter for the anarchists and their Spanish Photo Agency, thanks to a photo that was published in the UK magazine, Weekly Illustrated.\nAfter seven months working for the propaganda office, Horna published Spain? A Book of Images on Stories and Fascist Smears: The Anti-Fascist Propaganda Album. With her Rolleiflex camera, she covered various fronts, including Arag\u00f3n, Valencia, X\u00e0tiva, Gandia, Silla, V\u00e9lez Rubio, Alc\u00e1zar de San Juan, Barcelona and Madrid. She also took portrait photos of a number of the FAI commanders as well as the famous anarchist Emma Goldman and soldiers from the Ascaso Division stationed close to the Carrascal forest.\n\u201cHer work was done in the service of an ideology; a work of propaganda that continued to evolve along with the war,\u201d says Rubio. \u201cShe worked day and night. She was a militant photographer, not an artist,\u201d adds the historian. Horna\u2019s photos were also used in response to a smear campaign launched by Franco against his enemies.\nKati Horna\u2019s recently discovered work is imbued with unique dramatic narrative without the immediacy of actual war photos. In contrast to the images taken by Capa, Taro and Seymour \u2013 who were on the front line \u2013 Horna went in pursuit of a life that ran parallel to that of the trenches, in which death was not at the forefront. She preferred authenticity to news, reflected in her picture of soldiers shaving, and sought a different connection with what she was photographing, preferring a degree of involvement.\nKatalin Deursch, Kati Horna\u2019s real name, never saw her camera as an appendage, but rather as an extension of herself. Her life and her photos were inseparable. Her vision was an integral part of who she was and she was in control of a destiny that took her to the Roma neighborhood of Mexico City where she continued her career until her death, collaborating with a number of publications, as well as exploring surrealism and associating with artists such as Remedios Varo and Leonora Carrington.\nEditor Jos\u00e9 Luis D\u00edaz, who was a close friend during those years, would describe Horna, as \u201can aristocrat by birth, an anarchist by conviction, a seductress by nature and a vagrant by vocation \u2013 a combination that carries an implicit nostalgia for what is lost and surprise for what has been found.\u201d\nTogether with Horna\u2019s pictures, Rubio has also identified work by the Polish-born photographer Margaret Michaelis, who was also Jewish and worked for the CNT-FAI. \u201cMichaelis\u2019s case is different,\u201d says Rubio. \u201cHer dealings with the CNT-FAI were carried out undercover. Margaret had been living in Barcelona since 1933 and had her own studio. She was well known and formed part of the anarcho-syndicalists and, I believe, they trusted her to accompany Emma Goldman on her visits to the rearguard in Catalonia, Arag\u00f3n and Valencia in 1936.\u201d\nHorna\u2019s daughter Ana Mar\u00eda Norah Horna y Fern\u00e1ndez is the heir and custodian of her work, which has recently been shown in Mexico City, Paris and New York. These exhibitions along with a biography by Lisa Pelizzon entitled, Kati Horna: Constellations of Sense, have led to a reassessment of Horna.\n\u201cThe bitter experience of the Spanish Civil War left a profound mark on my mother,\u201d writes her daughter in one exhibition catalogue. \u201cAfter personally experiencing the insurmountable distance between the theory and practice of war time, my mother maintained a profoundly critical stance toward all kinds of dogmatism.\u201d\nOther specialists, however, believe that Horna remained true to her original ideas until the day she died.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.", "date": "08/23/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
