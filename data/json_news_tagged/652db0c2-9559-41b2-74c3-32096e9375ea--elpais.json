Labor unions traditionally call strikes at the busiest time of the year, when there is high demand for transportation services (Christmas, Easter, summer and long weekends). Although most of these strikes are only followed by a small number of workers, or are even called off early, the establishment of minimum services means that hundreds of trips have to be canceled, disrupting passengers\u2019 holiday plans.\nThis year, the Public Works Ministry has set the minimum services at 75% of the usual frequency on the Cercan\u00edas commuter line at rush hour, and 50% at other times. Renfe workers must also provide 65% of medium-distance train services, 78% on the AVE and 25% of freight services.\nThe strike will begin on Wednesday, July 31, with work stoppages between 12pm and 4pm and again between 8pm and midnight. It comes just over two weeks after the CCOO union called a rail strike on July 15, leading to the cancellation of 320 train services.\nOn a normal day, there are around 3,500 Cercan\u00edas trains, 600 medium-distance services and 382 long-distance and high-speed trains, according to Renfe.\nThe CGT union has described the minimum services as \u201cexcessive\u201d\nThe state rail company will give travelers the option of taking another train with a similar departure time, or else refunding or changing their tickets at no extra cost, according to a press release published on Monday.\nThe CGT union has described the minimum services as \u201cexcessive,\u201d and said in a press release that the Public Works Ministry was causing a large imbalance between \u201cthe fundamental right to strike and the right to mobility.\u201d The union is demanding an increase in the worker replacement rate to curb the outsourcing of services, as well as greater internal promotion and better working conditions.\nThe CGT union has minority representation in Renfe, and only gained two of the 13 committee representative positions at the last union elections that took place in May.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "07/30/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
