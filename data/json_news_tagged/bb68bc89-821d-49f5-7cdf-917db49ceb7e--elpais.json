In the Valencia region, which also attracts large numbers of tourists, the partners in the governing coalition \u2013 Comprom\u00eds and the Socialist Party (PSOE) \u2013 are at odds over the matter.\nIn Catalonia and the Balearics, an overnight accommodation tax is paid at hotels, hostels and holiday rentals, while cruise ships pay for docking at the port (the charge ranges from \u20ac0.45 to \u20ac5 per person per day depending on the type of accommodation and its location). In the last tax year, Catalonia collected \u20ac56 million in tourist taxes, half of that amount in Barcelona. And the Balearics took in \u20ac122.7 million.\nAt the time of their approval, these taxes were heavily criticized by hotel industry leaders who said they would reduce tourism numbers. But the evidence shows that they have had little effect, and in fact have proved inefficient against overcrowding. The main goal of the taxes was to raise funds to fix the damage caused by mass tourism to the environment and to the local cultural heritage.\nSince the tax was introduced in the Balearics in 2016, international tourist arrivals have actually increased from 12.9 million at the close of that year to 13.8 million in 2018. And in Catalonia, arrivals have surged 23% since the charge became effective in 2012.\nThe hotel industry says the tax is unfair because it only targets them, not restaurants, entertainment or transportation\nA comprehensive report on local financing made in 2017 for Spain\u2019s Treasury department mentioned \u201cempirical studies that suggest a very small negative impact on tourist arrivals from this type of levy.\u201d\nIn a recent article published by the Economic Magazine of Catalonia, Josep Andreu Casanovas of the consulting firm Cegos and Jordi Suri\u00f1ach of Barcelona University explored whether more tourists would have come to Catalonia without the tax. \u201cIn all the strategies that were used, and for all variables considered, the conclusion is always the same: it was impossible to prove that the tourist tax has had a negative effect on tourism demand in Catalonia.\u201d\nThe tourism lobby group Exceltur admits as much. \u201cBut careful, because the tide is turning,\u201d warns the group\u2019s vice-president, Jos\u00e9 Luis Zoreda. \u201cThe circumstances are changing, a slowdown is on the way, there\u2019s Brexit, and the considerable effects of [the collapse of] Thomas Cook.\u201d\nThis lobby group notes that Spain has been benefiting in recent years from additional tourism as travelers avoided politically unstable situations in Turkey, Egypt and Tunisia, but says that this could quickly change again.\nManel Casals, director general of the hotel industry group Gremi d\u2019Hotels de Barcelona, says that the city council initiative \u201ccomes at a very bad time.\u201d He describes it as \u201ca populist measure that does not have tourism policymaking in mind, but is purely for collection purposes.\u201d\nIn the Balearics, hotel owners who are still grappling with the overnight collapse of British travel giant Thomas Cook are now demanding the elimination of the eco-tax, aimed at repairing the damage of mass tourism to the islands\u2019 ecosystems.\nThe hotel industry also calls the tourist taxes unfair because they only target accommodation, not restaurants, transportation, museums or entertainment.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/10/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
