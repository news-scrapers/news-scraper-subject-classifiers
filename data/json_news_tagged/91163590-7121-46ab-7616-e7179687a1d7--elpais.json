The far-right group initially said it would only offer its support if the conservative parties agreed to a series of demands that included repealing articles of laws protecting LGBT+ rights, working to repatriate undocumented migrants to their home countries, and passing on the medical bills of undocumented migrants in Madrid to their countries of origin. The far-right group also wanted to be part of the regional government.\nBut after months of negotiations, Vox agreed to discard these demands and presented a new series of conditions in a document on Thursday. In the document, the far-right party calls for lower taxes, the creation of a social affairs, family and natality department, and guarantees to protect the freedom of school selection. Vox also demands that security forces be given access to information regional authorities have on migrants in irregular situations, for a large part of development funding to go towards regional initiatives against depopulation, and for \u201call types of harassment, discrimination and violence\u201d to be treated the same, without differentiating between victims.\nThe new demands were accepted by Ciudadanos, which has been heavily criticized for its dealings with the far-right group. \u201cWe have found a common denominator, remaining loyal to our values, our programs and our principals,\u201d Aguado said on Thursday, after giving the green light to the document.\nThe PP has governed Madrid region uninterruptedly since 1995\nCiudadanos\u2019 decision paves the way for Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, of the PP, to be sworn in as the next premier of Madrid. \u201cIt will be the first time Madrid region is governed by a coalition government with the support of another group,\u201d she said on Thursday.\nThe regional leader of the Socialist Party (PSOE), \u00c1ngel Gabilondo, described Vox\u2019s list of demands as \u201cdisturbing.\u201d According to Gabilondo, \u201cthe spirit of the document is conservative, right towards the extreme and moves the entire government proposal in this direction.\u201d\nAt the May 26 regional election, the PSOE won the highest number of seats (37), but even with the support of the leftist groups M\u00e1s Madrid (20) and Unidas Podemos (7), it did not have enough votes to defeat the right-wing bloc of the PP (30), Ciudadanos (26), and Vox (12).\nA date now needs to be set for the investiture ceremony to swear in Ayuso as the next regional premier. The PP has won all regional elections in Madrid since 1991, and governed uninterruptedly since 1995.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/02/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
