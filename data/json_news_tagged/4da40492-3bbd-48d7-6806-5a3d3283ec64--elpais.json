This figure is above the official statistic of 330,000 Britons who are officially registered in Spain, according to Interior Ministry data, given that there are estimates of a number of UK citizens who have not yet registered as official residents as their status as EU citizens afforded them rights without the need for paperwork.\nS\u00e1nchez also referred to the extraordinary meeting of ministers that he presided over last week in order to revise all of the measures that have been put in place so far and identify pending tasks. \u201cSpain is ready for any scenario, including a hard Brexit,\u201d the prime minister told Congress, saying that he wanted to convey a \u201cmessage of calm\u201d to citizens and the companies that may be affected.\nThe British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar \u2013 located in the south of Spain, and which voted overwhelmingly to remain in the 2016 Brexit referendum \u2013 is likely to be a key element for Spain when the UK leaves the EU, given that the border there will constitute a frontier between the EU and what will be a third country. Conscious of the importance of \u201cThe Rock,\u201d as Gibraltar is commonly known, S\u00e1nchez extolled the measures secured for the British Overseas Territory in the negotiations between Brussels and London for an orderly withdrawal. S\u00e1nchez presented as a strength something that at the time of the talks was seen as a weakness: that the veto that Spain has over any benefit that Gibraltar may be granted as part of Brexit is contained within a separate document, rather than forming part of the so-called withdrawal agreement. This means that Spain\u2019s right to give its approval or otherwise to including Gibraltar within any ordered withdrawal framework is valid even in the case of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 although the UK is highly likely to contest this point.\nAs many as 400,000 Britons in Spain may apply for the new immigration status\nS\u00e1nchez also sought to draw parallels between the situation in the UK, which he said was mired in a \u201cserious constitutional crisis,\u201d and the polarization in Spain over the issue of Catalan independence. \u201cNot even democratic Britain is safe from trivialization via polarization and splits,\u201d he told the deputies in Congress. \u201cWe will take note and act accordingly. We need to be the best version of ourselves.\u201d\nSpain is on course to hold its fourth general election in as many years in November, given that talks between S\u00e1nchez\u2019s PSOE and left-wing Unidas Podemos have failed so far to come up with a governing deal. The PSOE won most votes at the April 28 polls but fell short of a majority and will need the support of Unidas Podemos as well as other smaller parties if it is to form a government.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/11/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
