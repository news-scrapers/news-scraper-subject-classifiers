The YouTuber was the first to jump, but his parachute failed to open for reasons still under investigation. The young man fell to the ground and died on impact.\nThe victim\u2019s friend called the emergency services at approximately 1am and local police from San Vicente and an emergency SAMU ambulance attended the scene shortly after, though the paramedics were unable to do anything, according to a spokesman from the emergency services in the Valencia region (CICU).\nThe case is now in the hands of forensic and judicial police officers.\nThe victim\u2019s YouTube channel had just six subscribers and showed the victim doing various stunts, including a jump from a bridge and different parachuting and paragliding maneuvers. The failed parachute jump from the tower was to be uploaded to the channel, according to sources close to the victim.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/08/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
