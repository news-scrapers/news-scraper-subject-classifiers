They are worried: they need money for a driver\u2019s license or to sign up to the policy academy, but they don\u2019t have a single eurix, the official currency of this mini-city. This is Micropolix, a capitalist theme park for kids located in San Sebasti\u00e1n de los Reyes in Madrid, where children play at being adults: they work, drive cars, wait in line, have bank accounts and obssess about money.\nAna, my eight-year-old cousin, joins me on my visit to Micropolix, which will be closed for the summer until September. She has been my Trojan horse to visit the theme park, where adults can only enter if they are accompanied by a child.\nAt the ticket counter \u2013 admission fees are between \u20ac9 and \u20ac19 depending on the day and your age \u2013 Ana receives 50 eurix and a passport that accredits her as a citizen of Micropolix. I receive a brochure that explains that kids can work a number of jobs (banker, vet, store clerk) in 15 to 30-minute periods, for which they earn 30 eurix. They can spend the money in training \u2013 to be a doctor, a police officer, or getting a driver\u2019s license \u2013 or they can save it in the bank. \u201cKids become adults for a day. They will experience everyday situations of real adult life through play,\u201d Micropolix explains on their webpage.\nAdults can only hold some of the jobs, and with some exceptions, they are always spectators. Or \u201ctourists\u201d as they are called here. Luckily, property speculation doesn\u2019t exist in this mini-city and no child tries to rent me an Airbnb. But what does exist are social classes: those who have come to Micropolix before and have eurix they\u2019ve saved, and those who are first-timers. Ana came a few months ago and with 200 eurix in the bank she is now part of the nouveau riche.\nEn el plat\u00f3, los ni\u00f1os pueden ser c\u00e1maras, regidores, concursantes, presentadores...

It\u2019s not compulsory to go, but you get 30 eurix more if you do a job that is assigned to you. Ana is tasked with working at the television studio, which recreates the set of a game show, where the kids work as the film crew, play the host or, in the case of my cousin, act as contestants.\nMicropolix also has its very own wallet, which costs \u20ac3.50 (they don\u2019t accept eurix, I tried) and is wrapped around the waist like a fanny pack, which adds to the feeling of being in a trap video clip.\nAs well as worrying about money, the kids also have to be time-conscious. The door of each workplace announces the time it opens and its capacity, between 10 and 30 children. If you arrive late, you are left out and do not earn any eurix. Everyone wants to be friends with the kid with the watch, like \u00c1lvaro who has 400 eurix and tells us \u201cif you don\u2019t want to wait in line, you can ask someone to do it for you for 10 or 20 eurix.\u201d\nIn Micropolix, there are scams and shady practices. We saw some kids who, after working a job for just a few minutes, claimed they had to go, that their parents were waiting for them, only to cross paths with them at another workplace. We also heard of police fining kids 20 eurix for running or not having their passport with them. But when it was Ana\u2019s turn to be a police officer, there was no mention of fines. The role was to serve and protect.\nAs a police officer, Ana was part of a security cordon for a show in the central square of the mini-city. When the music ended, a kid on the second floor started to throw eurix in the air. There was a moment of chaos when the children, even the ones acting as police officers, ignored the adults and rushed to pick up the money.\nFor a few hours Micropolix turns kids into fierce, self-made entrepreneurs. But between the boasts and the rush to get to work on time, a seed for a young Bolshevik has perhaps been planted.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "07/31/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
