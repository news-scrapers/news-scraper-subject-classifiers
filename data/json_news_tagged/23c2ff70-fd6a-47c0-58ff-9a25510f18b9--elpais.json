The lawyer is being investigated in Andorra for unlawful association and money laundering, according to a court order to which EL PA\u00cdS has had access.\nCollado, who is well known in Mexico as the go-to lawyer for the powerful thanks to his work for authorities and politicians, was arrested on July 9 in Mexico City. Since then, he has been held in prison accused of several crimes.\nIn Andorra, alarm bells had gone off six days before the arrest, when the prominent lawyer transferred \u20ac10.5 million ($11.6 million) from his accounts in the small principality to a BBVA bank account in Madrid, Spain.\nCollado\u2019s assets in Banca Privada d\u2019Andorra (BPA), and those of all other BPA clients, had already been temporarily frozen in March 2015, when the lender was targeted over alleged irregularities. Later, a judge from Andorra, Can\u00f2lic Mingorance, also froze Collado\u2019s funds in connection with an investigation into alleged money-laundering offenses.\nBut that investigation was provisionally shelved in 2018, during Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s Mexican presidency, when prosecutors in that country sent the Andorra judge reports to prove that Collado had not committed any crimes. \u201c[Collado] obtained lawful income. No criminal proceedings are warranted,\u201d said Anah\u00ed Marcela Mendoza, who was then the representative for Mexico\u2019s state prosecution services. Mexico\u2019s response forced the Andorran justice system to shelve the case, as it is not possible to seek a conviction for money laundering without proving that the funds came from unlawful sources.\nBut Collado\u2019s recent arrest in Mexico on money-laundering charges has turned the case around, reactivating the Andorra investigation. On July 31, Andorran prosecutors asked for the case to be reopened, and for an immediate freeze of the \u20ac76,540,582 deposited in a lender named Vallbanc in accounts to the name of four Dutch shell companies controlled by Collado. The prosecution said that the lawyer\u2019s arrest was based on new evidence that authorities in Andorra \u201chad been unaware of,\u201d and that as such, the case in Mexico could not be considered to have concluded.\nThe prosecution\u2019s written argument says that \u201cthis situation entails the renewal of a logical and reasonable suspicion regarding the assets kept in Andorra under Collado\u2019s name or that of companies that he represents: the suspicion that there is a criminal origin to these assets. There is a risk that the assets will be transferred abroad before the facts can be cleared up.\u201d\nProsecutors also noted that on July 3, six days before being arrested in Mexico, Collado transferred \u20ac10.5 million from his accounts in Andorra to another account with Spanish lender BBVA in Madrid. \u201cAll the assets could be transferred in the same way if urgent measures are not immediately taken,\u201d warned the prosecutors.\nA judge from Andorra, Maria \u00c0ngels Moreno, has accepted this urgent request by prosecutors and cancelled the earlier decisions to shelve the investigation into Collado, made in October 2018 and May 2019. In a decision dated August 1, Judge Moreno ordered the cautionary freeze of \u20ac76.5 million held by Collado and four Dutch shell companies controlled by the latter. She also ordered Collado to be investigated for unlawful association and money laundering. The judge has also sent a formal petition for assistance to judicial authorities in Mexico, requesting all relevant information on Collado\u2019s recent arrest there and his ties with criminal activities.\nThe judge has also ordered a similar investigation against Cristina Lozano, the former deputy general director for business at BPA, and against Joan Marc Masson, a former bank employee.\nIn July, an EL PA\u00cdS investigation revealed moves by the Mexican prosecution services at the time of Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s presidency to release Collado\u2019s money and get the Andorra investigation shelved. When the lawyer\u2019s fortune was frozen, Collado formally asked Mexican prosecutors to investigate the origins of his funds, and the latter concluded that no criminal action was required. This meant that the case was closed and could not be investigated again. But now, authorities in Andorra are claiming that Collado\u2019s recent arrest sheds new light on previously unknown facts that warrant a reopening of the case.\nAuthorities in Mexico have used a similar procedure \u2013 opening an investigation and concluding that no criminal action will be taken \u2013 with other influential Mexican clients who have funds at BPA. One of them is the governor of the state of Mexico, Alfredo del Mazo. This newspaper previously revealed the existence of a bank account belonging to him that was opened in 2012 and contained \u20ac1.5 million. Del Mazo also managed to get his funds unblocked and the probe against him shelved.\nCollado\u2019s arrest in Mexico last July caused unrest among authorities in Andorra, where the heads of the judicial and police investigations felt deceived. Between 2006 and 2015, Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s lawyer handled a total of $120 million (\u20ac109 million) through a network of 24 bank accounts at BPA, at a time when Andorra maintained banking secrecy.\nIn their written request for a freeze on Collado\u2019s Andorra-based fortune, prosecutors underscored that he is a prominent criminal defense lawyer known for his defense of cases involving \u201clarge-scale drug trafficking, money laundering and corruption,\u201d and that \u201chis main clients are individuals with ties to large drug cartels.\u201d\nIn court statements he made before Judge Can\u00f2lic Mingorance in July 2016, Collado said that the money he kept in Andorra came from his own lawful business activities. He said that he headed a law firm with 40 professionals, and that his clients included 10 public agencies as well as the trade union at Pemex, the Mexican state oil company. His firm had made profits of \u20ac45 million in 14 years, he said. Another source of income, according to Collado, was the microcredit company founded by his father in the 1990s, which expanded into 66 branches, employed 500 workers and had revenues of \u20ac84 million in 14 years.\ninvestigacion@elpais.es\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/16/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
