His wife, Queen Sof\u00eda, visited him after the surgery and underscored his sense of humor in statements to reporters: \u201cHe never loses it.\u201d\nFelipe VI and his wife, Queen Letizia, also visited Juan Carlos and noted that he was already making jokes despite the post-operation discomfort. Letizia described him as \u201cvery brave\u201d and said that Juan Carlos\u2019 granddaughters Leonor and Sof\u00eda will be coming to see him in the coming days.\nThe heart surgery was scheduled after Juan Carlos underwent a checkup in June. The hospital\u2019s managing director, Luc\u00eda Alonso, described the procedure as \u201ca success.\u201d\nNo statements have been made yet as to when Juan Carlos might leave the hospital, where he was admitted on Friday night. \u201cEverything is going well, but we need to be patient because this was a major surgery,\u201d said Felipe VI.\nThis is the second time that the emeritus king has undergone surgery at Quir\u00f3nsalud Madrid, located in Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n outside the Spanish capital. The first time was in 2013, when he had hip surgery.\nJuan Carlos, who is credited with defending the country against a military coup and leading Spain\u2019s democratic transition in the late 1970s, retired from public duties in May of this year.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/26/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
