The consumption of alcohol is prohibited among soldiers when they are on duty or carrying weapons.\nThe consumption of alcohol is prohibited among soldiers when they are on duty or carrying weapons\nIn the photo above, which quickly went viral on social media, several groups of soldiers in uniform are clearly drinking bottles of beer while their automatic weapons are visible on the ground next to them. The photo, which has shocked the residents of Vilafranca, prompted many comments on social media, including a tweet from the congressional spokesperson for the Catalan Republican Left party (ERC), Gabriel Rufi\u00e1n. \u201cNo doubt that after a beer your machine gun is lighter.\u201d For its part, the Vilafranca branch of radical left-wing Candidatura d\u2019Unitat Popular party (CUP) demanded that the soldiers leave the town.\nAccording to sources from the army, the company spent Friday night in Sant Climent Sescebes (Girona) and, after resuming their journey, they stopped between 11.45am and 12.20pm on Saturday next to a supermarket in Vilafranca del Pened\u00e9s so that the the bus drivers could make a mandatory stop and the soldiers could buy food for the rest of the trip, as their arrival in Ronda (Malaga) was not scheduled until early Sunday morning.\nNormally, according to the same sources, weapons should remain inside the buses under the custody of a guard during stops. However, the head of the unit considered it safer for soldiers to take their weapons with them, as the buses were going to take advantage of the stop to refuel. Sources from the army added that the weapons were not loaded and that there were no incidents with the general public.\nEnglish version by Alicia Kember\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/01/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
