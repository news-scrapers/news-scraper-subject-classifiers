Early indications suggest that the body is that of a 66-year-old man of Dutch origin who disappeared on Sunday in the municipality of Dolores after being swept away by floodwater.\nSince Thursday, areas of the southeast have seen torrential rainfall, flash flooding and rivers with burst banks as the result of what is known in Spain as a gota fr\u00eda, literally \u201ccold drop,\u201d a weather phenomenon that occurs when a polar air front meets warmer conditions on the Mediterranean coast.\nThe first two victims of the conditions, a brother and sister, lost their lives in Caudete, Albacete on Thursday, when their vehicle was washed away by floodwater. On Friday, the body of a man was recovered after he accidentally drove into a tunnel in Almer\u00eda that had been closed off due to flooding. Later that same day another man lost his life in a ravine in Baza, Granada. Also on Friday, a man aged 58 was found dead in an area of Orihuela (Valencia), while the body of a 41-year-old man was located in La Matanza (Valencia) on Saturday.\nThe seventh victim was located today by a man on a quad bike in San Fulgencio, Alicante. The motorist called the Civil Guard and informed the authorities that the body had the characteristics of the missing man: white hair, a tattoo and the clothes that he was wearing when he went missing.\nSpain\u2019s Insurance Compensation Consortium (CCS), a public insurer that covers natural disasters, has announced that it will pay out at least \u20ac190 million to cover the damage caused by the recent extreme weather events in Spain. Around \u20ac92 million will be sent to the Valencia region, with most of the remainder to go to neighboring Murcia. These regions were the worst hit by the \u201ccold drop\u201d that began last Thursday.\nThe CCS stated, however, that these figures were preliminary and that they were based on urgent reports carried out by insurance adjusters after analyzing the affected areas, a task that was made more difficult this past weekend given that the rainfall and flooding continued, and some areas were not accessible.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/17/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
