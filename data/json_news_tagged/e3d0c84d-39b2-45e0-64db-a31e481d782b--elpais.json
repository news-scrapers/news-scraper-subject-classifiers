L., the Spanish company that spied on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during his stay at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, doing in Alexandria, Virginia?\nLocated around 10 kilometers from Washington DC, Alexandria is home to the US federal court that has been investigating the Australian cyberactivist for years and has requested his extradition from the United Kingdom, where he remains in prison after he was expelled from the Ecuadorian embassy in April following a seven-year asylum.\nMorales was in Alexandria near the date when WikiLeaks announced the publication of Vault 7\nAn analysis of emails sent by Morales to several of his employees shows that this former member of the military was in Alexandria on March 1 and 2, 2017. The IP addresses of these messages, which EL PA\u00cdS has seen, show that at the time that they were sent Morales was in Alexandria, where a federal court is seeking\u00a0Assange\u2019s extradition on 18 counts stemming from accusations that he revealed classified intelligence about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, which could lead to a prison term of 175 years.\nMorales was in Alexandria near the date that WikiLeaks announced the publication of Vault 7, a collection of thousands of documents about an alleged cyber-surveillance program by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) capable of compromising cellphones, smart TVs and computers with internet access produced by US companies, transforming them into microphones to spy on their users. The disclosure revealed an enormous security gap at the CIA and triggered a scandal similar to the ones involving former CIA subcontractor Edward Snowden and former intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.\nUC Global S. L. spied on Assange for the CIA, as shown by testimony and documents disclosed by this newspaper. Morales allegedly gave the intelligence agency audio and video material on the cyberactivist\u2019s meetings with his lawyers and collaborators at the embassy. Following this newspaper\u2019s revelations, Judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata of Spain\u2019s High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, agreed to consider a criminal complaint filed by Assange against Morales, who was arrested and is now the target of an investigation into alleged violations of Assange\u2019s privacy and attorney-client privilege, as well as misappropriation, bribery, money laundering and illegal possession of arms.\nMorales often traveled to the United States. The IP addresses of the emails he sent his workers showed him to be variously in New York, Dallas, Miami, Washington, Chicago, Lakewood and Las Vegas. At this last location, the messages were sometimes sent from the hotels owned by Sheldon Adelson and his Las Vegas Sands Corporation. Morales has been working for the billionaire business magnate for years, taking care of security on the latter\u2019s yacht during trips to the Mediterranean. The company\u2019s personnel includes a former CIA official. Adelson is one of the main donors to the Republican Party and a personal friend of Donald Trump.\nAlthough UC Global had been hired by Senain, the secret services of Ecuador, to watch the embassy in London, Morales confided to a few trusted employees that they were also working \u201cfor the Americans,\u201d to whom he was allegedly handing over video and audio footage of Assange\u2019s conversations with his visitors at the embassy.\nUC Global S. L. spied on Assange for the CIA, as shown by testimony and documents disclosed by this newspaper\n\u201cI want to alert you to the fact that we have to be very careful about the information that we send over...and tell everyone to be careful with the information... Senain (the secret service of Ecuador) is investigating us. That\u2019s why I would like, in the first place, for my geographical location to be handled with discretion as much as possible, especially my trips to the US,\u201d wrote Morales in an email addressed to several of his workers.\n\u201cWe have been informed of suspicions that the guest [this is how Assange was alluded to] is working for the Russian intelligence services, thus the profiling of his visitors and aides,\u201d he wrote in another message.\nMorales ordered his workers at the Ecuadorian embassy in London to spy on, and record the conversations of, any Russian or US citizens who visited the WikiLeaks founder.\nOn November 22, 2018, several months after UC Global had stopped providing its services at the embassy, Morales asked his employees whether they had any records of visits by Paul Manafort in 2013, 2015 and 2016. The subject line of this e-mail message said\u00a0\u201cQuery.\u201d\u00a0 Manafort is a US lawyer who joined Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016. He has since been sentenced to three and a half years in prison for various irregularities and for conspiracy as a member of a lobby group in Ukraine. Sources close to the cyberactivist state that Manafort never visited Assange. Manafort himself denies ever having met with the founder of WikiLeaks.\ninvestigacion@elpais.es\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/08/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
