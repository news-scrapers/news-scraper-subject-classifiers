That\u2019s according to a new report from the European federation of environmental associations, Transport & Environment (T&E). According to the study, emissions of the greenhouse gas have fallen 32% thanks to the initiative, which made 4.7 square kilometers of the city center off-limits to traffic, except for local residents and public transportation. This figure, however, is taken from the only measuring station within the low-emissions zone.\nToxic air is estimated to decrease life expectancy of every European by an average of almost one year\nT&E report\nMadrid Central was introduced under the former leftist administration of Mayor Manuela Carmena at the end of 2018. The current mayor of Madrid, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida from the right-wing Popular Party (PP), tried to suspend the plan when he took office in June, but was blocked by the courts, which argued that the measure was needed to stop pollution from rising \u201cwithout any kind of control.\u201d The plan remains in place and drivers who enter low-emissions zones without the proper permissions are fined \u20ac90, or \u20ac45 if the amount is paid immediately.\nThe report says that greater awareness of the problems associated with pollution has led all European cities to introduce or strengthen low-emissions zones that are off-limits to polluting vehicles. \u201cMore than 250 EU cities have already taken such measures,\u201d according to the study, which pointed out that \u201ctoxic air is estimated to decrease life expectancy of every European by an average of almost one year.\u201d\nThe report also added that 67% of EU citizens interviewed either \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d support the introduction of low-emissions zones.\nGloria Rodr\u00edguez-Pina\nFines for entering Madrid Central without authorization soared from 13,361 in May \u2013 when municipal elections were held \u2013 to 79,908 in June, according to local registers. That is a sixfold rise, which Mayor Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida said is proof that his predecessor Manuela Carmena \u201cand her team did not believe in Madrid Central.\u201d\n\u201cWhat they wanted was a propaganda tool to help them win the election,\u201d said the Popular Party (PP) mayor on Monday. The previous governing team says it opted for a gradual rollout of penalties, and the goal was not so much sanctioning drivers as reducing pollution.\nAccording to Nuria Bl\u00e1zquez, the transportation coordinator of the environmental group Ecologists in Action, which belongs to T&E, the main problem is that there is no clear \u201clegal definition\u201d of what is a low-emissions zone. The term could be applied to areas with strict restrictions or those with very little effectiveness. \u201cThat is the case, for example, in German cities, where there are only restrictions against the oldest vehicles, and there has been no change [in pollution levels],\u201d says Bl\u00e1zquez.\nThe reason why Madrid Central is so effective is that only cars with a zero-emission tag can enter the low-emissions zone. All other vehicles (with some exceptions) must stay outside the area, which dissuades drivers from taking to the most central roads.\nThe T&E report argues that low-emissions zones are key to the effectiveness of anti-pollution measures but says that neither Madrid nor any other mayor European city have met the EU limits on air pollution.\n\u00a0English version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/12/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
