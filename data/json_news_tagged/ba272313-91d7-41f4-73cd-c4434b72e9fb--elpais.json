Neither he nor his neighbors in the British Overseas Territory, located on the southern coast of Spain, have any idea of what kind of hand they are about to be dealt, though it is fairly obvious that a no-deal Brexit will affect people and vehicles crossing the border as well as supplies for companies and conditions for employees who cross over for work.\nAccording to John Isola, head of Anglo-Hispano, a company of 300 employees importing alcoholic drinks and supplies for the catering industry, with so many question marks, it is impossible not to be concerned. \u201cOur border is outside the Schengen Area and the European Customs Union. Nothing should change on October 31, but, as we know, this border is used to cause trouble, when it suits\u201d he says with skepticism.\nIsola is worried about importing perishable goods once Britain leaves. Gibraltar has no border inspection post, the nearest being at the port of Algeciras \u2013 general goodwill currently means that trucks carrying perishables don\u2019t have to go that extra mile and pass through there. Isola is also worried that a hard Brexit could have a negative impact on tourism. \u201cIt would affect what we buy, what we sell and the employment that we generate,\u201d he says.\nAt the end of the day, most of the headaches will revolve around the border of Gibraltar, a place that would have the third-biggest income per capita in the world, were it a country. Each day, an average of 28,500 people cross from one side to the other.\nAs we know, this border is used to cause trouble, when it suits\nJohn Isola, head of company Anglo-Hispano\nOn a number of occasions, this same border has been behind political tensions with Spain. October 31, the day that Brexit is due to happen \u2013 with or without a deal, according to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson \u2013 is causing Loren Peri\u00e1\u00f1ez, president of the Cross Frontier Group and a businessman based in La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n, more than a few sleepless nights as he considers the implications for the 15,000 employees making the daily journey to the other side. More than 9,000 of them are Spanish, according to estimates by Gibraltar\u2019s authorities.\n\u201cLa L\u00ednea will then be the EU\u2019s external border and if there is a check on documentation for all the vehicles that leave, we could have hour-long delays,\u201d says Peri\u00e1\u00f1ez.\nNumerous concerns reach his inbox every day from people who are worried whether they will keep the unemployment benefit they currently have a right to in Spain or if they will be expected to have a visa to cross the border to work. Exacerbating the situation is the value of the pound against the euro, which has meant a 25% drop in wages in real terms for Spaniards working in Gibraltar.\nMany of the current concerns were sorted out in the 2018 agreement between Spain and the UK, but in the event of a no-deal, this agreement would no longer be valid, according to the Gibraltar authorities. They have also been addressed by Spanish legislation designed to cover a possible no-deal scenario. Meanwhile, the Gibraltar authorities have their own contingency plans with legislation that covers all the citizens\u2019 rights acquired during the years as part of the EU.\nAt the end of the day, Picardo is not denying that there will be huge\u00a0appetite for cooperation between Spain and Gibraltar in a post-Brexit era. \u201cThese are issues that have more to do with attitudes and human relations. We are in favor of a legal framework, but while this is happening, as the time frame is tight, we are trying to think that the positive spirit will pervade on October 31,\u201d he says, while warning against the alternative: \u201cIf we want to create a big problem, this is the perfect opportunity. If we want to work in good faith, we know what we need to do.\u201d\nLast June, Gibraltar and La L\u00ednea observed the 50th anniversary of the unexpected 1968 border closure \u2013 a measure taken by the regime of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco that split families in two and impoverished the area. The Gibraltarians still have an element of the stoicism that was forged over the ensuing 13 years of isolation. As the jeweler Antonio Mart\u00ednez says as he sits on a bench in Main Street: \u201cFranco has gone. There is common sense on both sides.\u201d\nIn two months, he will be proven right \u2013 or wrong. Picardo, for one, is not willing to say which way the situation will swing. \u201cNobody knows what the consequences of the coming days will be,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cI think they are going to be vertiginous.\u201d\n\u00a0English version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/03/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
