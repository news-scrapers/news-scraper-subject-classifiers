Military personnel were deployed to the region to help rescue thousands trapped inside vehicles, homes and campsites.\nAuthorities warn that it is still too early to put a precise figure on the damage caused by the most devastating storm since 1879, when floodwaters killed over 1,000 in Murcia and Orihuela, according to the national weather agency AEMET.\nThe head of the Valencia region, Ximo Puig, has asked for \u201csomething like a Marshall Plan\u201d to help with reconstruction, and the regional government of Murcia wants its own damaged areas to be declared a disaster zone.\nSpain\u2019s acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, visited affected areas on Saturday, and said he would return on Monday.\nThe slow-moving storm system, known officially as an upper-level isolated depression (DANA) but more popularly in Spain as a gota fr\u00eda, literally \u201ccold drop,\u201d began moving northwest on Sunday after losing a lot of its destructive power.\nTypical of the autumn season in the Mediterranean region, the \u201ccold drop\u201d causes violent downpours in a short space of time. Ontinyent in Valencia province recorded 250mm of rainfall in 12 hours, around 10 times the normal amount for this time of the year. Gale-force winds also triggered small tornadoes in places like the seaside resort town of D\u00e9nia.\nOne of the worst-hit municipalities was Orihuela, a town of 75,000 residents in Alicante province, which was cut off for three days due to flooded roads. The latest reported fatality, a 41-year-old man, was from Orihuela.\nSantiago de la Ribera (Murcia) this morning #gotafria the beach has disappeared... pic.twitter.com/DtsS3tjdSi\nThe area of southern Alicante province known as Vega Baja was particularly hard hit after the Segura river overflowed, submerging thousands of hectares of flat agricultural land that is often referred to as Europe\u2019s orchard.\nOther Vega Baja municipalities such as Almorad\u00ed and Dolores continued to evacuate people on Sunday out of fear that the Segura would overflow again.\nThe Alicante Association of Young Farmers (Asaja) said that around 150,000 hectares of cropland located between Elche and Pilar de Horadada will be lost. And Murcia\u2019s Union of Small Farmers and Stockbreeders (UPA) provided a similar figure. But the total number is bound to be significantly higher once other affected areas calculate the damage.\nAfter battering eastern Spain, the storm started moving west, causing some damage in the provinces of Guadalajara and Toledo. In the Madrid region, there was some flooding in Arganda del Rey, where the subway connection to the Spanish capital was temporarily closed.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/16/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
