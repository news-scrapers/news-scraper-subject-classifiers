Party leader Albert Rivera on Saturday surprised supporters by announcing that he is lifting the \u201cveto\u201d on doing deals with the Socialist Party (PSOE) that he introduced in February of this year.\nWe\u2019re back at the political center\nCiudadanos senior official\nCiudadanos\u2019 months-long refusal to negotiate with PSOE leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who won most votes at the April election but lacked a majority to form a government, triggered resignations by four senior party officials who disagreed with Rivera\u2019s shift to the right. And a majority of polls show a drop in voter support for Ciudadanos (of around three points, according to an average calculated by EL PA\u00cdS) compared with April, when it was the third most-voted party.\nSpeaking to a crowd of supporters at a Madrid auditorium, Rivera on Saturday unveiled a list of 10 socially oriented reforms that he would like to enact through a broad agreement with Spain\u2019s \u201cconstitutionalist\u201d forces, i.e. parties that respect the Spanish Constitution, as opposed to those that support unlawful breakaway bids.\nOnly a handful of individuals knew at this point that Rivera was also going to announce that if right-wing parties fail to secure a governing majority on November 10, he will be open to talks with Pedro S\u00e1nchez to help him form a Socialist government. Several members of Ciudadanos\u2019 executive committee have admitted that they were informed of this decision on Saturday morning, the day of the rally.\n\u201cWe were born to overcome the dichotomy between the reds and the blues,\u201d said Rivera on Saturday, in a speech of over an hour that took him back to Ciudadanos\u2019 original rhetoric of reform. \u201c[On election night] I will call the PSOE and Pedro S\u00e1nchez so we can sit down and talk about these reforms. If Spaniards decide that the government must be led by Pedro S\u00e1nchez, by the PSOE, and if they send us to the opposition, my commitment remains unchanged: I will support all of these national reforms even if we are not in power,\u201d he told a crowd of around 500 people.\nThe list of reforms backed by Ciudadanos includes measures to raise the birth rate, improve education and the public health system, and fight rural depopulation. Party chief Albert Rivera also wants to eliminate special privileges for politicians such as partial immunity from the courts. Other initiatives include lowering taxes for families \u201cwherever possible,\u201d a plan against job instability, \u201cdignified\u201d pensions and an overhaul of electoral laws. Rivera also said there should not be \u201cprivileges\u201d for some regions of Spain, in a veiled reference to the Basque Country, which collects nearly all of its own taxes.\nParty leaders said that Ciudadanos is not contemplating the option of a joint government with the PSOE, but rather an abstention or a favorable vote at the investiture session that will precede the new prime minister\u2019s appointment.\nAsked why Ciudadanos refused such a deal with the PSOE earlier, when it could have avoided its own internal fracture and the need for a repeat election, one party official said that it is \u201cbecause before this, there was a different alternative,\u201d alluding to the months-long possibility of a leftist government by the PSOE and anti-austerity bloc Unidas Podemos with support from Catalan separatist parties. This option ultimately did not pan out, leading to the recent dissolution of parliament and new elections.\nThe announcement was well received by leading party members. \u201cIt is a return to the essence of the party,\u201d said one official. \u201cFor me, it would have been better not to have a repeat election, but better late than never,\u201d said another. \u201cWe\u2019re back at the political center.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Spain\u2019s main conservative party is also making overtures to the PSOE ahead of November 10. Pablo Casado, the president of the Popular Party (PP), was in the northwestern region of Galicia on Sunday to send out a new message of moderation, following a strident campaign earlier this year during which he had called Pedro S\u00e1nchez irresponsible, incapable, disloyal, incompetent, mediocre, and a compulsive liar, among other epithets.\nAfter losing 71 seats at that election, Casado is now avoiding highly charged political issues and focusing instead on the economy with a message that only the PP can save the country from an impending new crisis.\nHe also told potential voters that \u201cif the PP wins just one more seat than the PSOE, we will seek governing formulas with all the \u2018constitutionalist\u2019 parties.\u201d Both Ciudadanos and the far-right Vox have so far refused to join the PP in an electoral alliance named Espa\u00f1a Suma.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/07/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
