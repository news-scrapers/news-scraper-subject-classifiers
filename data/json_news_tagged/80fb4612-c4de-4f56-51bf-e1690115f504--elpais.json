Twenty students meet on a vacant lot near Madrid\u2019s university area to initiate freshmen into the vagaries of college life. The roles are clearly defined. The veterans are well dressed and armed with cartons of cheap wine. The freshmen are wearing costumes and are already drunk. In one corner, a new student is on his knees vomiting while five others egg him on. \u201cYou\u2019re going to keep on drinking until we see your dinner diced!\u201d screams out one of them.\nAs September comes around again, so does this supposed rite of passage. Several weeks ago, the controversy over these initiation rituals surfaced once more in the wake of a viral video of an aggressive punch during one such session. Both parties, who were living at Complutense University\u2019s Diego de Covarrubias student residence in Madrid, were suspended for two weeks.\nIf you have never been through it, it\u2019s hard to understand why we don\u2019t say no\nLucas, university student\n\u201cSuspensions don\u2019t solve anything,\u201d says Loreto Gonz\u00e1lez-Dopeso, the president of the support group No m\u00e1s novatadas (No More Hazing), which addresses complaints from students and parents of students who have been at the receiving end of these initiation ceremonies.\nThe group has received 40 complaints across Spain in the last year regarding rituals ranging from cold showers in the small hours of the morning to enforced drinking.\nLaura Croas, a psychologist specializing in issues related to bullying, believes that the tradition persists because students are scared to report it, and because the victims figure that they will be the hazers further down the line. \u201cYou accept being a freshman because later you will be the veteran,\u201d she explains.\nCroas says that although some of the rituals seem harmless, hazing plays on the victim\u2019s emotions and can leave its mark. The most common problem among her patients is knowing how to say no.\n\u201cAt that age, belonging to a group is all important, and you accept humiliations because you\u2019re scared of the consequences if you don\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you have not learned how to say \u2018no\u2019 for fear of being ostracized, that will continue to be a problem for you as an adult.\u201d\nCroas also shines some light on the veterans\u2019 role and why hazing tends to go too far. \u201cIn group therapy, we can clearly observe our capacity as human beings to abuse power in an assumed role,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an erroneous way of channeling the rage we carry inside us.\u201d\nAt that age, belonging to a group is all important, and you accept humiliations because you\u2019re scared of the consequences if you don\u2019t\nLaura Croas, psychologist\nThis is what is known as a power rush, and it comes with a thought: \u201cI was once on that rung, but now I have climbed higher.\u201d\nMadrid\u2019s Complutense University has launched its annual anti-hazing campaign this September together with the local police and city authorities. Other universities are trying alternative methods in a bid to phase out the practice. Salamanca University, for example, has opened an anti-hazing meeting point for the first time, where established students help the newcomers. \u201cThey feel more comfortable with one another,\u201d says the vice-rector Ana Bel\u00e9n R\u00edos. \u201cThat\u2019s the key.\u201d\nExtremadura University, meanwhile, has launched its first campaign with a focus on sexual harassment and food waste, in a nod to rituals involving coating newcomers in products such as flour.\n\u201cThe phrase \u2018the freshman is not a snitch\u2019 still carries weight,\u201d says Loreto Gonz\u00e1lez-Dopeso who insists that a lack of reported incidents doesn\u2019t mean they are not happening.\nFor example, Jos\u00e9 (not his real name), the father of a former student in Madrid who moved after a year of being shunned by his classmates, says that he would have liked to have reported what was happening to his son but refrained for fear of making his life even worse.\nMeanwhile, Lucas (also an assumed name), who used to live at the Covarrubias student residence, says that although he was humiliated, he was never the one making others suffer. \u201cThey were the typical macho guys who enjoy bullying the weakest,\u201d he says. \u201cThe worst they did was make me eat my own vomit mixed with soup. If you have never been through it, it\u2019s hard to understand why we don\u2019t say no. It seems easy from the outside, but when you are part of it, you feel you have no choice.\u201d\nNot all students have bad memories of hazing, however. Roc\u00edo, for example, lived at the Marqu\u00e9s de la Ensenada residence and says that it was all quite tame. \u201cThey made us learn stuff about the veterans or get drunk,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they never went too far.\u201d Roc\u00edo believes that it is thanks to these rituals that strong bonds were forged with her classmates.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/26/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
