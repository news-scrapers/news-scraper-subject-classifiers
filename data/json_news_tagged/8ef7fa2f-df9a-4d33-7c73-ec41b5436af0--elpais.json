The Socialist Party (PSOE) won most votes at Sunday\u2019s poll, but once again fell short of a majority.\nIt is a bad result, without excuses or mitigating circumstances\nCiudadanos leader Albert Rivera\n\u201cIt is a bad result, without excuses or mitigating circumstances,\u201d admitted Rivera in a brief statement shortly after 11pm on Sunday. A red-eyed In\u00e9s Arrimadas, the party\u2019s congressional spokesperson, stood next to him.\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, Rivera explained his reasons for quitting. \u201cOut of responsibility, I must resign from this position,\u201d he said. \u201cBad results belong to the leader.\u201d He went on to announce that he was also quitting as a deputy in Congress, saying that he was doing so \u201cfor the good of the project.\u201d He added that he wanted to \u201cmake way for another deputy who is passionate about entering Congress. I have never been tied to a seat in politics.\u201d He made clear that he was \u201cleaving politics. Public life. I have enjoyed it, and I have learned.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Ciudadanos lost more than 2.5 million votes and gave up 47 seats in Congress, leaving the once-surging force with just 10 representatives in Spain\u2019s lower house.\nIn\u00e9s Arrimadas is the most likely candidate to succeed Rivera\nCiudadanos is now Spain\u2019s sixth party in terms of its congressional presence, behind the far-right Vox, the anti-austerity Podemos and even the separatist party Catalan Republican Left (ERC), which managed 13 seats.\nFollowing this crushing defeat, Rivera gathered his executive committee on Monday morning and announced his resignation. An extraordinary party congress will decide who takes over as the new leader.\nThe Catalan-born politician, who is not yet 40 years old, took over the reins of Ciudadanos 13 years ago on a liberal reform program that gradually shifted to the right as Rivera sought to compete with the conservative PP.\nFollowing the April 28 election, he refused to negotiate a governing agreement with caretaker Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez of the PSOE, and has recently been competing with the far-right Vox for votes, triggering resignations by senior party officials who disliked Ciudadanos\u2019 new approach.\nArrimadas is the most likely candidate to succeed Rivera, but there are other party figures who could be in the running, such as Luis Garicano, who represents Ciudadanos in the European Parliament.\nEnglish version by SImon Hunter and Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/11/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
