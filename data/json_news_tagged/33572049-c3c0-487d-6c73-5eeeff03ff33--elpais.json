They would throw out their trammel nets in the hope of catching salmon, sole, bream and cuttlefish, but instead pull up dozens of kilos of brown-colored algae. It is not your typical algae, it is Rugulopterix okamurae, a foreign species that has attacked the southern Spanish peninsula with unusual virulence, threatening the marine biodiversity of the area and piling up on beaches.\nIt\u2019s aggressively taking over the entire sea floor of the Strait\nTarifa Mayor Francisco Ruiz Gir\u00e1ldez\n\u201cIt\u2019s an environmental catastrophe,\u201d says Nicol\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez, the secretary of the C\u00e1diz Federation of Fishermen's Associations, which represents more than 170 ships in Conil, Barbate, Tarifa and Algeciras. On the other side of the Strait in M\u00e1laga, Pedro Benzal, the president of the Estepona Fisherman\u2019s Association is equally worried. \u201cI have never seen anything like it,\u201d he says.\nThe fishermen estimate that trammel net ships have lost almost 100% of their catches, while trawlers have lost half. The brown algae was identified for the first time in Spain\u2019s exclave city of Ceuta in North Africa in 2015, and in just four years has spread across the entire coast of C\u00e1diz province in the south of Spain, reaching as far as Huelva and Marbella on the Atlantic coast. A year and a half ago in the coast of Tarifa, it started to become clear that the algae was becoming a problem, according to the town\u2019s mayor, biologist Francisco Ruiz Gir\u00e1ldez. \u201cIt\u2019s aggressively taking over the entire sea floor of the Strait,\u201d he explains. The algae occupies up to 50% of the space between five and 25 meters of depth.\nThe scientific community is also alarmed by the \u201cmeteoric and completely unprecedented\u201d growth of the algae, says Jos\u00e9 Carlos Garc\u00eda, a researcher at the Marine Biology Laboratory at the University of Seville. \u201cWe have not found any precedent of a bioinvasion that has been so explosive,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThe dimensions of the sargassum invasion in Mexico and the earlier Ulva [lactua, commonly known as sea lettuce] invasion in China are greater, but they did not spread as fast as here,\u201d explains F\u00e9lix L\u00f3pez, a professor of ecology at the University of M\u00e1laga. Both experts were among the dozen of scientists who met last week with the members of the Organization for Science, Education and Global Society to find a solution to the problem and offer their help to authorities.\nJust on the beaches in Estepona, 2,800 tons of seaweed have been collected in the last six weeks\nThe Rugulopterix okamurae algae is native to the warm waters near China, Korea, the Philippines and Japan. It is believed to have arrived in Spain on board one of the ships that sail through the Strait of Gibraltar. It took a while for it to be detected because it looked like local species of algae.\nSince its arrival in Spain, the algae has grown unstoppably. It is not only having a negative impact on the fishing industry, it is also hurting biodiversity \u2013 destroying local algae species and taking up the space used by many animals \u2013 as well as the tourism industry.\nThe coast is being covered in 50 centimeter-tall blankets of rotting algae. Just on the beaches in Estepona, 2,800 tons of seaweed have been collected in the last six weeks. In Tarifa, the algae only affects around 600 meters of the beach, yet \u20ac10,000 has had to be invested in collecting the seaweed and taking it to landfills. \u201cIt\u2019s Groundhog Day. You take it [the algae] away one day, and the next day it\u2019s back again,\u201d says Tarifa Mayor Ruiz Gir\u00e1ldez.\nAccording to F\u00e9lix L\u00f3pez, the spread of the algae is due to several factors \u2013 the algae has no predators, it is able to attach itself to rocky ground up to 25 meters deep as well as latch on to crabs, rocks and even other algae, and it has benefited from the inadequate treatment of waste water. Even fishermen have been unwittingly helping the species to spread. When they lift up their nets, the algae that is returned to the sea stays alive and distributes millions of spores.\nAll agree that urgent action needs to be taken to address the problem. \u201cWe are calling for an eradication plan and for studies from different perspectives to better understand the species and how to act against it,\u201d says Ruiz Gir\u00e1ldez. In the short-term, removing the algae from the sea and the beach at regular intervals could be considered. But in the long-term, the best solution would be to find a way to at least control the spread of the algae.\nIn the meantime, Ruiz Gir\u00e1ldez and Fern\u00e1ndez have asked the central government and the regional government of Andalusia for financial aid to alleviate the cost of the fishing losses and the unanticipated expense of cleaning up the beaches.\nI have never seen anything like it\nPedro Benzal, president of the Estepona Fisherman\u2019s Association\nThe heads of the regional environmental department and the Ecological Transition Ministry have held several meetings to learn about the expansion of the algae. And the Ecological Transition Ministry has also created a special task force \u2013 with representatives from Andalusia, Ceuta and Melilla \u2013 to begin the process of adding the algae to Spain\u2019s list of exotic invasive species.\n\u201cUntil then, we can\u2019t do anything,\u201d Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez, the regional government\u2019s agriculture delegate in M\u00e1laga, recently said. According to the regional head of agriculture, Carmen Crespo, the algae should be declared an invasive species \u201cby the end of the year at the latest.\u201d\n\u201cWe hope it is not too late. Because if we cannot work until then \u2026 many families are going to have a really hard time,\u201d explains Manuel Haro, from the Marbella Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Association, which has moored half of their fleet for a month. The algae has consumed their nets.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/26/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
