According to figures from the EU\u2019s statistic agency Eurostat, based on 2017 data, 8.8% of women in the country were over 40 when they gave birth to their first child. In the previous 2015 study, Italian women had the greatest tendency to come to motherhood late.\nStatistics show that 25-30% of childless women at 40 are not mothers because they cannot get pregnant\nAlbert Esteve, director of the Demographic Studies Center\nThe phenomenon in Spain has been building over the past decade, with births from mothers aged 40 and over rising 63%, according to the National Statistics Institute (INE). Spanish youth are among the latest to leave home in the EU (average age is 29), while the average age for first-time mothers is 31. Figures show an average of 1.25 children per woman in 2018.\nA number of experts point out that more than half the women who are not mothers would have liked to have had children but a prolonged wait due to the lack of secure employment, difficulty finding an affordable place to live and a lack of state subsidies, has worked against them.\nOther women simply prefer to be older mothers, a cultural shift based on the desire for greater economic and professional stability.\nItaly and Spain also lead the EU when it comes to giving birth at 50 and over \u2013 which contrasts sharply with the 92% of Europeans who have their first child between 20 and 39.\n\u201cMethods, such as assisted reproduction, allow for childbearing age to be extended but there are no miracles,\u201d says Albert Esteve, director of the Demographic Studies Center at Barcelona\u2019s Autonomous University. \u201cThe fertility statistics in Spain show that 25-30% of childless women at 40 are not mothers because they cannot get pregnant.\u201d\nAccording to Esteve, there are economic reasons behind the statistics. \u201cWe are among the countries where independence happens later due to the lack of job security, low salaries and difficulty finding a place to live, factors which mean that people cannot leave home when they want to.\u201d\nOver 60% of first-time mothers are between 30 and 39, the highest figure in the EU\nThe European birth map highlights a clear divide between trends in the South, where there are less young mothers and more mature ones, and the East, \u2013 Bulgaria and Romania \u2013 where one out of every eight babies has a mother under 20. Hungary and Slovakia come in behind Bulgaria and Romania which have the highest percentage of young mothers, and very few first-time mothers over 40.\nTogether with a higher fertility rate and lower life expectancy, this means the East is getting younger while the South is getting older.\nIn Spain, it is becoming increasingly rare to have children before the age of 30 \u2013 60.2% of first-time mothers are between 30 and 39, the highest figure in the EU. In Greece, Ireland, Italy and Luxembourg, women are also more likely to give birth for the first time in their 30s than their 20s.\n\u201cIf couples leave it later and later to have children and women become mothers when they are more mature, many will end up not being able to have children and this is what is happening in Spain,\u201d says Diego Ramiro, a demographic expert at the Spanish National Research Council. \u201cMore than 20% of women born in the 1970s will not have children. We have not yet caught up with Japan where the figure is almost 30%, but there could be long-term consequences. For example, when people get old, they won\u2019t have a family network to look after them and other care systems will have to be put in place.\u201d\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/07/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
