The victim was admitted to the Bellvitge Hospital with \u201cmultiple facial injuries,\u201d and was reportedly awaiting surgery. According to the hospital, the injury is consistent with the impact of a rubber bullet, which are used by the National Police, but could also have been caused by a foam bullet, which are used by the Catalan regional police force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra.\nOver 130 protesters required medical attention\nOfficers from both forces charged against demonstrators after thousands of independence supporters blocked access routes to the airport on Monday night in an organized protest against a Supreme Court ruling that sentenced nine separatist leaders to prison terms for the unilateral secession attempt of 2017.\nThe emergency services attended to 131 people who were injured in the clashes, 24 of whom needed to be taken to hospital. Another 16 people required medical attention across Catalonia.\nDuring the charges, the Catalan riot police used foam bullets, a precision weapon that is not fired at the ground, while the National Police were using rubber bullets, which should be fired at the ground and then bounce toward their target, in a less precise way than the foam bullets. The Catalan regional parliament banned the regional police from using rubber bullets because of their potential to cause injury. Rubber bullets are, however, used across Spain by the National Police and the Civil Guard.\nLawyers from the human rights firm Iridia say that at least six of the 131 people injured in the police charges were hit by either a rubber or foam bullet, according to Spanish news agency EFE. As well as the victim who lost an eye, the lawyers say another person was hit very close to the eye area. Several journalists also reported on social media that they had been injured in the police charges.\nThe minister of the premiership of Catalonia, Meritxell Bud\u00f3, justified the \u201cisolated\u201d police charges, arguing they were aimed at \u201cprotecting the demonstrators.\u201d In an interview with the Catalan radio station RAC 1, Bud\u00f3 said \u201csometimes these actions have to be carried out to refrain from other actions that could be worse.\u201d\nThis is not the first time a protester has suffered an injury like this one in police clashes in Catalonia. On November 14, 2012, Ester Quintana was wounded in a general strike when she was hit by a rubber bullet fired by Catalan riot police, and subsequently lost one of her eyes.\nMeanwhile, the Catalan regional interior department will investigate the actions of Mossos d\u2019Esquadra riot police on Monday during the disturbances at El Prat. A video (above) shows a police van in motion while two demonstrators are on the hood of the vehicle. In an internal report, to which Spanish news agency EFE has had access, the department has decided to analyze the images of the incident to \u201cdetermine eventual responsibilities, in accordance with the protocols of police procedures.\u201d\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/15/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
