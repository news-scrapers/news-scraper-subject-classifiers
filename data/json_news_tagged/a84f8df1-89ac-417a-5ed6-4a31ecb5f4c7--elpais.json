On Monday, Spain\u2019s top court sentenced nine Catalan separatist leaders to between nine and 13 years in prison after finding them guilty of sedition in connection with the unilateral breakaway attempt of October 2017. Oriol Junqueras, the former deputy premier of Catalonia, received the heaviest sentence: 13 years for sedition and misappropriation of public funds.\nThe verdict has been met with anger by pro-independence groups in Catalonia, which began to demonstrate in the streets and to block traffic on Monday morning.\nThere were clashes at Barcelona airport between the regional police and independence supporters after thousands of demonstrators stormed the facilities. Around 20 flights have been canceled according to Aena, the airport authority. At around 5.30pm Mossos d\u2019Esquadra officers were still trying to clear the area between Terminal 1 and the parking zone, where the bus and taxi stops to the city center are located. The action at El Prat was called by a platform known as Tsunami Democr\u00e0tica (Democratic Tsunami), which distributed fake boarding passes and called on demonstrators to use any means possible to get to the airport, even on foot. In Girona, around 300 people blocked off railroad tracks used by conventional trains and by the high-speed AVE service.\nEarlier in the day, Democratic Tsunami, which has no visible leaders, called on its followers to take to the streets. The pro-independence group uses the instant messaging service Telegram to communicate with its network, which has more than 125,000 Telegram subscribers, 67,000 Twitter followers, 25,000 Instagram followers and a closed Facebook group with 2,600 members.\nConcentraci\u00f3n en \u00d2mnium tras conocerse la sentencia.

The 300 people yell chants like: \u201cOur sentence, disobedience,\u201d and: \u201cWe all know they are innocent\u201d and sing songs like Bella Ciao.\nOn orders from the Mossos, trains headed to El Prat were halted, while the Metro service was also suspended between the Parc Nou and Terminal 1 stations. Spanish airports authority AENA was recommending on Monday for passengers to give themselves extra time to reach the airport. Airline Vueling, which operates the highest volume of flights at El Prat, stated on Monday afternoon that there were no delays or cancellations to flights as a result of the protests, but warned that some passengers may not get to the airport in time to catch their flight.\u00a0\nThe high-speed AVE train service was also interrupted at 2pm, after around 100 protestors invaded the tracks at Girona station, despite a heavy police presence there. Hundreds of people also occupied the regular train service platforms and lines in the same city at around 12.45pm.\nEstudiantes movilizados tras #SentenciaDelProces \"vaciamos las aulas llenamos las calles\" #Barcelona https://t.co/KD12eCUk47 pic.twitter.com/0mGng0qWQg\nStudents mobilize after the Supreme Court ruling: \u201cWe will leave the classroom and fill the streets.\u201d\nOn Monday morning, in the wake of the ruling, the protesters cut off several major avenues, including the Ronda de Dalt and La Rambla, and traffic was badly congested on the N-260 highway between Navata and Figueres in Girona, according to the Catalan traffic service.\nIn Barcelona, around 300 protesters gathered outside the headquarters of \u00d2mnium Cultural, a pro-independence organization headed by Jordi Cuixart, who was sentenced to nine years in prison and given a nine-year ban on holding public office for his role in the breakaway attempt. The protesters waved signs reading: \u201cFreedom for political prisoners,\u201d and yelled chants such as: \u201cWe all know they are innocent,\u201d and: \u201cOur sentence, disobedience.\u201d\nIn the Catalan parliament, around 100 workers and lawmakers held a silent protest to demonstrate against the Supreme Court ruling. And Barcelona City Council will hold an extraordinary plenary session next Thursday to let parties take a stand on the political situation. Committee sessions scheduled for the coming days have been pushed to next week.\nIn Girona, Lleida and Manresa, pro-independence groups took to the streets to protest the Supreme Court ruling. Students protested in Sant Jaume square in the center of the Catalan capital, while others blocked off traffic with a sit-in at University square. Staff at the Clinic, Bellvitge and Sant Pau hospitals demonstrated outside hospital buildings.\nIn a message on Twitter, the grassroots pro-independence group Committees to Defend the Republic (CDR) called for \u201cdisobedience,\u201d writing: \u201cNow is the time to rise up against the authoritarian fascism of the Spanish state and its accomplices.\u201d\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/14/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
