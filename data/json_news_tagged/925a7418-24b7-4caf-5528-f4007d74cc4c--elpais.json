The police arrested the alleged kidnapper, but an investigation, code-named Operation Camerita, revealed that the suspect was in fact the man\u2019s drinking buddy and that the story had been invented to cover up for having spent all the night\u2019s earnings on a wild night out. The victim, turned out to be the suspect, and the real story very different to the one reported to police.\nPretending to be a victim of a crime can carry a jail sentence of up to a year or a fine\nThe man, who was working as a driver for a ride-hailing service with a VTC license, told the police in July that a passenger threatened him with a knife and ordered him to drive to a brothel in Fuengirola, where he was made to take drugs. Once he had spent all the money he had made that night, the man claimed the customer made him drive to a \u201cfriend\u2019s house\u201d to sell his motorbike in order to continue spending money on \u201cdrugs and having sexual relations with the women at club.\u201d But the abduction did not finish there, however. According to the driver, he was forced into a taxi that drove him and his alleged kidnapper to a garage where he was held for several hours.\nThe investigating officers have concluded that the driver and the alleged kidnapper were known to each other and that the driver was not held against his will at any point. Rather, he handed over the money from the sale of the motorbike \u201cvoluntarily\u201d because that was the agreement he made with his drinking pal. But he subsequently tried to justify having spent his night\u2019s earnings and the money from the sale of the bike with a far-fetched version of events.\nThe police have warned of the seriousness of false allegations, not only as it wastes public money but also because the resources could be otherwise employed. Moreover, pretending to be a victim of a crime can carry a jail sentence of six months to a year or a fine, depending on the seriousness of the allegations.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/08/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
