According to a post on Vox Otura\u2019s Facebook page, the group objected to the fact that the winner was \u201ca young Moroccan girl,\u201d who had only been \u201cliving in Otura for two years.\u201d The post said that the winner should have been \u201cfrom Otura, Spanish and better looking.\u201d\nNot only was the original post xenophobic, but it was also untrue\nNot only was the original post xenophobic, but it was also untrue: the 16-year-old in question is Spanish, has lived in the country her whole life, and has been a resident of Otura for the last four years.\nMany Spanish cities run a competition to choose the reina de las fiestas, or \u201cqueen of the fiestas,\u201d to coincide with the yearly local festivities. The event is a kind of beauty pageant, where the winner is crowned. The queen holds her title for a year, until the next fiestas, and represents her city, town or village at public events.\nThe Otura queen, who has opted not to give her name, lets her older sister Kauty explain the situation. On Tuesday night, in a quiet moment, Kauty asked her sister how she was feeling. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the queen of the fiestas anymore,\u201d she replied.\n\n \u201cVox regrets the message published on this social network about the choice of the Queen of the Otura Fiestas. We regret the damage caused to the family of the young Spaniard. When the Vox communication department was made aware of the publication, the message was removed and an investigation was opened in order to clarify the facts.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived in Spain since I was born,\u201d explains the young beauty queen, complaining about the comments without fully understanding them. The next scheduled event at which she will appear is at Christmas, and her family is convinced that, in spite of everything, she will forget what has happened and will attend.\nThe youngster was among a group of six candidates who entered the contest on August 5, her sister explains. She went having been encouraged to do so by her friends, some of whom were her competitors. \u201cThere was also a Russian girl, but nobody said anything about her,\u201d Kauty explains. No one objected to the choice of queen at the time and the fiestas ran smoothly. On September 4 the coronation ceremony took place. \u201cShe was so happy with the party and with everything. It makes me so sad,\u201d says Khady, the girl\u2019s mother. \u201cBut there\u2019s good and bad the world over,\u201d she adds. The controversy has clearly been an unexpected shock for the family.\nThe xenophobic statement was posted on September 10 and left up for a week after publication, until the controversy broke out. Comments were posted below it, some in favor of Vox\u2019s statement and some against.\nThree reports about the post have already been filed with the Civil Guard. One came from Kauty and her mother, another from her aunt and uncle, and a third from the local council, which is run by the Socialist Party (PSOE) and where Vox counts on one councilor. The Granada public prosecutor is also investigating whether the comment constitutes a hate crime or an offense against moral integrity.\nThere was also a Russian girl, but nobody said anything about her\nThe beauty queen\u2019s sister, Kauty\nVox deleted the publication and the comments with it, and posted a new statement saying that it \u201cregretted the message\u201d and \u201cthe harm done to the family of the young Spanish woman.\u201d This newspaper has tried, unsuccessfully, to contact Vox in Otura to hear their side of the story and to find out if they maintain the belief that no Moroccan or foreign person can be crowned queen of a fiesta. The new comment from the extreme right-wing party insists that \u201cneither the content or the form corresponds to the political line and ideologies of Vox,\u201d and it adds that the incident is being investigated by the Civil Guard. According to Kauty, beyond the apology on social media \u201cno one from Vox has approached us or contacted us to apologize.\u201d\nLuckily, after stormy weather the sun always shines. Several days have now passed and the horizon seems clearer. \u201cI\u2019m better now,\u201d the young woman says with half a smile. \u201cMy friends are calling me, as are people in the town. I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been able to reply to everyone,\u201d she concludes. Her reign will last a year. The town still has plenty of opportunities to show her its affections.\nEnglish version by Alicia Kember.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/20/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
