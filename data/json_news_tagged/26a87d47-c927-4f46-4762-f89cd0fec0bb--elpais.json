According to the study, which is based on figures from the real estate website Idealista, rental prices rose the most in Palma and Barcelona (more than 50%), followed by M\u00e1laga, Madrid, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Valencia (around 45%), between the end of 2013 and May 2019. Areas in inland Spain however, saw the lowest spikes in rental prices.\nThe report found that the rental prices have increased at a \u201csignificantly\u201d faster rate than housing costs.\nThe rising cost of rent is hitting low-income homes particularly hard. According to the study, families with few resources, who account for the majority of the rental community, are less likely to buy property, given the difficulty of accessing credit. What\u2019s more, they spend a higher percentage of their salary on rent. The report showed that in 2014, the average spending on rental expenses represented 27% of the net income of all Spanish homes, and 46.9% of the net income of low-income homes. In both cases, Spain is above the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) country average.\nAccording to the report, \u201c24.7% of homes had rental costs of more than 40% of their net income in 2014, compared to the OECD average of 13.1%.\u201d Spaniards in the lowest income bracket spend 63.9% of their net earnings on rent, a figure only topped by Greece (68.6%).\nThe Bank of Spain report indicates that the increasing profitability of rental properties has attracted new players to the market such as investment funds, businesses and real estate investment trusts (known in Spain as socimis). The study, however, says this is not the only possible factor behind the rise in rental prices. Other causes include the precariousness of working conditions, which make it more difficult for Spaniards who are unemployed or in temporary jobs to buy property; the growing number of people moving to the cities in search of work; and the reduced amount of available social housing.\nThe Bank of Spain study does not reach any strong conclusions on whether the rise in short-term vacation rentals like Airbnb have pushed up the cost of rent in Spain. While the report makes note of the trend, it argues there is no proven correlation.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/08/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
