This is the second death to be officially attributed to the infection, which has affected 196 people in Andalusia and more than 200 people in the entire country.\nThe victim had \u201cprior illnesses,\u201d according to the information from the regional health authority\nThe victim had \u201cprior illnesses,\u201d according to the information from the regional health authority, and was within the at-risk population from the bacterial infection. She passed away at 1.15pm on Tuesday in the Virgen del Roci\u00f3 Hospital in the regional capital city, Seville.\nThe woman is the second person to die after having contracted listeriosis, after a 90-year-old female patient passed away on August 20. The health authorities are currently investigating whether a 74-year-old man who had terminal pancreatic cancer may also have died due to the infection, after the bacteria was detected within his bloodstream.\nOn August 12, a woman suffered a miscarriage after having contracted the infection, while another similar incident that took place on August 2 is also being investigated to see if it is related to the listeriosis outbreak.\nThe number of new cases appears to be slowing, with three infections confirmed today. On Monday, there were 68 patients in hospital receiving treatment for listeriosis, compared to 83 the day before. Of these, 26 are pregnant woman (28 the day before) who are receiving antibiotics. At the weekend six new cases were confirmed, and on Monday there was just one.\nThe number of new cases appears to be slowing, with three infections confirmed today\nThe Spanish Health Ministry on Monday confirmed the first possible case of listeriosis outside of Spain. The potential victim is a Briton who may have become infected with the bacteria while in the focal point of the ongoing outbreak, Andalusia, before traveling to France, where he was diagnosed with listeriosis and spent several days in hospital, then returning to his home country.\nA food company called Magrudis is suspected to be at the center of this outbreak, in particular its \u201cLa Mech\u00e1\u201d branded carne mechada product, a kind of pork loin that is cooked in its own fat and served sliced. Traces of listeria have been found in tests carried out on the Magrudis production line, including the oven carts used to transport the meat during the preparation process, and the larding needles used to inject the pork with fat before cooking. The crisis has been complicated by the fact that the company\u2019s products had been sold on to another firm and prepared for sale as an own-brand product in a supermarket chain without the proper labeling.\nListeriosis is a bacterial infection that can cause severe illnesses such as sepsis, meningitis and encephalitis, and can even be fatal. Those most at risk are pregnant women, the elderly, unborn babies and newborns, or people whose immune systems are compromised. The infection can also cause gastroenteritis and fever. It is primarily transmitted, as in this current outbreak in Spain, by the ingestion of contaminated foods.\nExperts consulted by EL PA\u00cdS agree that such a widespread presence of the listeria bacteria in the factory places the blame squarely with Magrudis itself. \u201cThis is not down to bad luck,\u201d explained Antonio Arena, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Cordoba. \u201cThe contamination of the foodstuff and its improper storage have caused a multiplication of the bacteria.\u201d\nThe businessman behind Magrudis, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00edn, eluded responsibility for the outbreak when talking to the media on Monday. \u201cWhy would I be fined?\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d He had previously spoken to Spanish daily Abc, asking: \u201cIf they find bacteria in operating theaters, why wouldn\u2019t they find them in my factory?\u201d Mar\u00edn\u2019s lawyer told EL PA\u00cdS that the head of the company had assured him that the firm was meeting all of its requirements in terms of health standards.\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/27/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
