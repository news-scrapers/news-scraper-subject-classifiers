But on Friday, the Spanish government released the data on all the Spanish Mauthausen victims in the Official State Bulletin (BOE), meaning names, places of birth and dates of death can be linked to the thousands of personal stories of the Republicans who fought in two wars and ended up in a concentration camp.\nThis is a way of giving them back their dignity\nAmalia Basante, magistrate of the Civil Registry\nAside from public recognition, the release of the data will allow family members to crosscheck the available information on the victims for themselves.\nThe list published by the BOE has been coordinated by a group of historians, led by professor Gutmaro G\u00f3mez Bravo from the Complutense University in Madrid who warns, \u201cThere are surnames or places of birth which could be wrong as many prisoners of war were scared of reprisals against their loved ones or their political colleagues.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Jorge del Hoyo, the academic coordinator of the inter-ministerial commission for the 80th anniversary of the Republican exile endured by 99.9% of the Mauthausen victims, says, \u201cIt is a valuable historical document but it has possible errors which is why an allegation process is being opened.\u201d\nSix hundred and ninety-five names have been added to the 4,427 found in the books after historians, funded by associations such as the Amical de Mauthausen (Friends of Mauthausen), embarked on an investigation in a bid to put names to all the Spanish victims of the Nazi genocide, including those who ended up in other camps.\nAccording to G\u00f3mez Bravo, recording these names is essential from the historical memory point of view given that these archives were deliberately hidden by the Franco regime. Gathered in 10 volumes, they should have been put at the disposal of the victims\u2019 families, which would have allowed them to claim compensation from both Germany and France.\n\u201cThe death of these people was never recorded in a civil registrar,\u201d says Amalia Basante, magistrate of the Civil Registry. \u201cThis is a way of giving them back their dignity.\u201d\nIt has been 74 years since the Republican prisoners welcomed US troops with an enormous banner that read: \u201cThe anti-fascist Spaniards salute the liberating forces.\u201d Nearly 10,000 Spaniards were sent to concentration camps located in the vicinity of Mauthausen in Austria, where they were used as slave labor in the granite quarries. Around half of these prisoners lived to tell the tale, but the names of those who did not survive the terrible conditions have remained under wraps until now.\n\u201cIn 1951, Spanish authorities received a series of records from France, with the identity, dates of birth and dates of death of the deceased citizens in the camps, above all in Mauthausen-Gusen,\u201d says Basanta.\nNearly 10,000 Spaniards were sent to Nazi concentration camps\nAccording to Del Hoyo, the information in the books was derived from the identity cards made by the Spanish prisoners under German orders. When the liberation of the camp drew near, the prisoners managed to prevent the Nazi officials from destroying the evidence of their crimes and part of the archive remained. One of the key figures behind this feat was Joan de Diego Herranz from Barcelona, who managed to survive the war, dying at home in Barcelona in 2003, aged 87. Only six prisoners remain alive today.\nMost of the victims were Republicans who had crossed the border into France in the last months of the Spanish Civil War and who became part of French Resistance. There were also women and children from the refugee camps in the south of France. When France fell under Nazi rule with Philippe P\u00e9tain as chief of state of Vichy France, these Republicans were taken to Austria on the suggestion of the Franco regime; Franco\u2019s governing minister and brother in law, Ram\u00f3n Serrano-Su\u00f1er, struck an agreement with the Nazis that all their Spanish prisoners of war should be taken to labor camps.\nBasanta explains that the publication of the names aims to provide redress for victims by rescuing them from obscurity. \u201cIt is a way of recognizing them as Spaniards because we have the capacity to register the deaths of Spaniards abroad,\u201d she explains.\nThe government has set May 5 as the day to honor the Spanish victims of Nazi concentration camps while the Ministry of Justice is also paving the way for a monument to be erected in Madrid in their memory. And through the legal acknowledgment of their death, the victims can finally, if only figuratively, return home.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/09/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
