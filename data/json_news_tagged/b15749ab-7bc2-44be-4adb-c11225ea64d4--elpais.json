The potential victim is a Briton who may have become infected with the bacteria while in the focal point of the ongoing outbreak, Andalusia, before traveling to France, where he was diagnosed with listeriosis and spent several days in hospital, then returning to his home country.\nListeriosis is a bacterial infection that can cause severe illnesses such as sepsis, meningitis and encephalitis, and can even be fatal. Those most at risk are pregnant women, the elderly, unborn babies and newborns, or people whose immune systems are compromised. The infection can also cause gastroenteritis and fever. It is primarily transmitted, as in this current outbreak in Spain, by the ingestion of contaminated foods.\nEL PA\u00cdS has also learned that the oven cart used at the Seville-based company at the center of the outbreak, a firm called Magrudis, has tested positive for the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes. Last week, EL PA\u00cdS revealed that tests carried out on larding needles used by Magrudis to make a pork loin product called carne mechada also returned positive results for the presence of the bacteria. It was this product, thought to be at the center of the outbreak, that the British tourist consumed while in Spain.\nThe preliminary test results on the oven cart have been obtained by the municipal laboratory of Seville City Hall, which is continuing to analyze dozens of samples taken from inside the plant to determine the origin and date of the outbreak.\nThe oven cart is a key element in the food plant, and is used at various stages of the production chain, both before and after the products are cooked. The samples that tested positive for the bacteria were taken after the roasting process. \u201cThis corroborates the fact that listeria was found in the entire plant,\u201d explained Jos\u00e9 Juan Rodr\u00edguez, a professor in nutrition and bromatology at Barcelona\u2019s Autonomous University.\nCarne mechada is made by cooking pork loin in its own fat. The lard is introduced into the meat using larding needles before it is cooked. It is then usually served cold and in thin slices.\n\u201cIt was present in the larding needles and now it\u2019s confirmed that is in the cart. This indicates that it could be on the food-preparation tables and that many other products could be contaminated,\u201d warned Rodr\u00edguez.\nOn July 31, Magrudis informed the Andalusian regional government \u2013 which is headed up by the conservative Popular Party and Ciudadanos, with support from the far-right Vox \u2013 that it had expanded its headquarters in the El Pino industrial area on the outskirts of Sevillle, work that needed to have been previously approved by the regional government. In its statement, the firm assured that it had maintained its \u201ctechnical sanitary conditions\u201d and self-control system as the work was being completed. This statement was sent 15 days after the date considered by the regional government to mark the beginning of the outbreak.\nMagrudis sells carne mechada, along with other similar products \u2013 such as lomo, preserved pork loin, and chicharrones, pork belly \u2013 under the brand name La Mech\u00e1. Seville City Hall confirmed on Friday that two other La Mech\u00e1 products were found to be contaminated: pork loin with sherry, and pork loin with paprika. Samples taken on August 21 from four other products \u2013 Andalusian chicharr\u00f3n, mantec\u00e1 color\u00e1 (orange-colored pig fat cooked with pork and spices), zurrapa de lomo (fried pork loin in butter and salt) and zurrapa de h\u00edgado (pork liver spread) \u2013 have tested negative for listeria, EL PA\u00cdS has been informed.\nOn Sunday, 10 days after the alarm was first raised by the health authorities about the outbreak, Magrudis released its first press release, claiming it was \u201cin a state of shock\u201d and \u201ccouldn\u2019t explain what had happened.\u201d According to the food company, they complied with all sanitary obligations and have a lab report from days before the product was packaged that showed it tested negative for the bacteria.\nThe press release came a day after the first tests on carne mechada produced by Magrudis and sold on to a firm called Comercial Mart\u00ednez Le\u00f3n for resale also revealed the presence of listeria. These products were in circulation with an own-brand label until they were ordered to be withdrawn on August 21.\nAll clients of Comerical Mart\u00ednez Le\u00f3n have since been contacted by the owner, according to municipal sources, but it is not known how much carne mechada was distributed. The authorities were not aware that the product had been sold on to Comerical Mart\u00ednez Le\u00f3n until August 21, six days after the initial health alert was raised.\nWhat\u2019s more, the carne mechada sold by Mart\u00ednez Le\u00f3n for resale was incorrectly labeled, according to the Spanish Agency of Food Safety and Nutrition (Aesan). \u201cIt has the same presentation as the [carne mechada] sold by Magrudis, no brand appears on the label and only the nutritional information is referenced,\u201d said Aesan.\nSandro Mar\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez is listed in the commercial register as the owner and administrator of Magrudis, but when the company was created in August 2013, he was just a university student thinking about dropping out of a pharmacy degree. \u201cThe company isn\u2019t his, it\u2019s his father\u2019s, it always has been. The son perhaps helps him now, but I had never even seen him until he appeared on television the other day,\u201d explained one client, who wished to remain anonymous.\nThe father, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mar\u00edn Ponce, has three failed businesses behind him. In 1993, he had a stake in the meat-trading company Sanmasue, which declared bankruptcy at the end of the decade. In 1996, Mar\u00edn Ponce founded a meat-retail business called Sierra Encina, which also had a short life. The business \u2013 which has a woman, presumably his wife, listed as the administrator \u2013 had unpaid loans in 2001 and 2003, according to the commercial register bulletin (Borme). And in 2000, he created Embutidos El Patio, which declared insolvency in 2012.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/26/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
