The scenes with the Brazilian player, who has made it known that he is a big fan of La Casa de Papel, as the show is known in Spanish, were only inserted once the public prosecutor in S\u00e3o Paulo shelved a rape allegation filed against him by the Brazilian model Najila Trindade Mendes de Souza.\nI was able to make my dream come true and be part of my favorite show!\nNeymar\nIn the version of the series that was released on July 19, there is no trace of the character played by Neymar, a Brazilian monk named Jo\u00e3o who speaks with protagonists Berlin and The Professor in episodes six and eight. It\u2019s a brief appearance, during which the player delivers ironic lines in Spanish about how he doesn\u2019t like soccer or partying.\nThe allegation filed by the model earlier this year meant that Neymar\u2019s sponsorship contract with Mastercard was put on hold, and, as sources from Netflix have confirmed to EL PA\u00cdS, the streaming giant cut the cameo from the final version of season three while it awaited news from the Brazilian justice system.\n\u201cI was able to make my dream come true and be part of my favorite show!\u201d Neymar wrote on Twitter several days ago about Money Heist, which has become a phenomenon in his home country. \u201cNow I can share Jo\u00e3o with all of you!\u201d he added.\nEu pude realizar meu sonho e fazer parte da minha s\u00e9rie favorita. E agora eu posso compartilhar o Jo\u00e3o com todos voc\u00eas !Gracias @lacasadepapel !#LCDP3 #nuevofichaje #lacasadepapel pic.twitter.com/fxwWieoP0N\nThe rape allegation was shelved at the request of the gender violence public prosecutor in S\u00e3o Paulo, who found a \u201clack of evidence\u201d for a rape case and \u201cattachment between the two parties.\u201d By then, millions of viewers the world over had seen the latest installment of the show, albeit without the presence of Neymar.\nBut the matter has not been closed entirely, and, like Money Heist, could still have a twist in store, given that the case could be reopened at any moment should new evidence appear.\nS. H.\nMoney Heist first debuted on Spanish television channel Antena 3 in 2017, but became a global phenomenon once it was picked up by Netflix. Since then, the heist drama, whose first season follows a group of thieves trying to steal billions of euros from Spain\u2019s Royal Mint, has won critical acclaim as well as a number of high-profile fans. The latest celebrity to profess their admiration for the show was none other than Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft Corporation and one of the world\u2019s biggest philanthropists. Speaking on the Awards Chatter podcast from the Hollywood Reporter ahead of the release of a Netflix documentary focusing on his life story, Inside Bill\u2019s Brain, Gates told interviewer Scott Feinberg that he is \u201cwatching a ton of these TV series, and waiting for the next season: A Million Little Things, Sex Education, Money Heist, The Queen\u2026 This is a magical time period in terms of the number of great things on TV.\u201d\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/04/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
