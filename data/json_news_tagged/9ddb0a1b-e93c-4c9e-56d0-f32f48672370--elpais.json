All the paperwork to build the pioneering 18-story tall \u20ac1.2 billion-scientific installation in Puntagorda is now in order. It is just up to the consortium behind the project to decide whether it will push ahead with its original plans to build the TMT in Hawaii, or switch to Plan B: the Canary Islands. If approved, work on the project will begin in La Palma next year in spring.\nMauna Kea continues to be the preferred site for the TMT\nTMT consortium sources\nThe consortium wants to build the TMT on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii, but Native Hawaiians have been blocking the construction of the telescope because they believe the site is sacred.\n\u201cWe are excited and grateful to have been granted the building license in La Palma,\u201d said sources from the consortium. \u201cMauna Kea continues to be the preferred site for the TMT, but this is a key step in the process to develop the Plan B site in La Palma, if it is not possible to build in Hawaii.\u201d\nThe TMT partners have called a meeting for November 23, and having approval to build in Puntagorda, could help the group decide what to do. But sources from the consortium explained that \u201ccurrently, there is no set date to determine our next steps for the building of the TMT.\u201d They added: \u201cThe TMT board of directors regularly meets. This is a scheduled meeting to follow the evolution of the project both in Hawaii and in La Palma, as well as other issues.\u201d\nThe consortium, which is made up of universities in the United States (California Institute of Technology and the University of California), Japan, India, Canada and China, requested the building license from Puntagorda city hall a few weeks ago. Under the license, 10 hectares of land will be ceded to the Canary Astrophysics Institute (IAC).\nIt is expected to take 10 years to build the telescope and its supporting installations. The project is likely to generate many jobs \u2013 and not only in the construction. Numerous technical position will be needed to oversee the scientific project, and more work could come from the development of equipment for the TMT.\nSpanish scientists would also receive 10% of the TMT\u2019s observing time to carry out their own projects\nThe TMT group also hopes to be a \u201cgood neighbor\u201d to La Palma, after facing opposition from Hawaii, and is expected to make significant investment in training and education.\nMore than a dozen telescopes are already functioning on the peaks of La Palma, some of which are run by scientists and engineers from the area. The TMT project could multiply the work opportunities for these locals. Spanish scientists would also receive 10% of the TMT\u2019s observing time to carry out their own astronomy projects.\nThe TMT began facing problems in 2014, when work began on the project in Mauna Kea, the highest summit in Hawaii, which the native people consider sacred. Although there are a dozen observatories already located on the summit, the Native Hawaiians had had enough. They blocked the roads and the building work was brought to a stop. A long legal battle ensued, which ended in July after a court gave the project the green light. But protesters began blocking the roads again. Four months later, the work is still at a standstill, and the project is beginning to fall out of favor with the public. Indeed, many high-profile scientists from the United States have asked for the telescope to be built in the Canary Islands.\nSpanish authorities at all levels, from Congress to the regional government of the Canary Islands, have shown public support for the construction of the TMT. What\u2019s more, the scientific leaders behind the TMT project have discovered that La Palma has excellent conditions for observing space. Although they are not as good as in Mauna Kea (which is 4,200 kilometers above sea level \u2013 nearly 2,000 kilometers higher than La Palma), the operating costs in the Canary Islands would be half the $40 million (\u20ac37 million) needed for the site in Hawaii \u2013 an important saving for an instrument that is expected to last 50 years. The project, however, has received criticism from the Spanish environmental group Ben Magec, which says the TMT will harm the local environment, and has promised in the media to oppose the plans.\nEnglish version by Melissa Kitson.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "11/21/2019, 20:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
