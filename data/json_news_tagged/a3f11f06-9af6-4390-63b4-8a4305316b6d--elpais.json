The late dictator\u2019s remains will be removed from the Valley of the Fallen monument on Thursday, October 24 at 10.30am, and transferred to the El Pardo-Mingorrubio cemetery, in Madrid.\nThe exhumation will take place shortly before a general election scheduled for November 10\nThe exhumation had been a signature initiative of the caretaker prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez of the Socialist Party (PSOE), and it was approved by Spanish Congress on September 13, 2018.\nBut it ran into opposition from Franco\u2019s family, which wanted his remains to stay at the Valley of the Fallen, a controversial monument located near El Escorial, in the mountains northwest of the Spanish capital. A series of legal challenges ended in late September when the Supreme Court authorized the exhumation.\nThe caretaker government had given itself until Friday to carry out the exhumation, but was delayed by events in Catalonia. The Valley of the Fallen has been closed to the public for more than a week, and the 50-kilometer distance between the Valley and the cemetery will probably be covered by helicopter, to prevent any potential roadblocks by pro-Franco demonstrators on the ground.\nThe 13.6-square-kilometer Valley of the Fallen site remains controversial in a country still struggling to come to terms with the legacy of the fascist dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who ruled over Spain from the end of the Civil War in 1939 to his death in 1975.\nThe site was ostensibly built to commemorate the victims on both sides of the war (1936-1939), and the unmarked remains of more than 33,000 victims of the conflict lie there. But critics point out that the Valley of the Fallen, which features a basilica and a 150-meter-high cross that dominates the surrounding countryside, contains just two marked graves: those of Franco himself and of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, the founder of the Falange, Spain\u2019s fascist-inspired political party. At the same time, thousands of prisoners of war who fought against Franco were among the workforce used in its construction.\nThe move will come shortly before a national election scheduled for November 10, and the PSOE administration is hoping that it will boost voter support at a time when many Spaniards are reeling from the week-long scenes of street violence seen in Catalonia, in the wake of the prison sentences against nine separatist leaders who headed the illegal secession bid in 2017.\nThe issue of Franco\u2019s remains has been a thorny one throughout Spain\u2019s democratic history. The PSOE was in power for 22 years before Pedro S\u00e1nchez became prime minister through a no-confidence vote in late May 2018, but neither one of his Socialist predecessors \u2013 Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, who held office for 14 years, and Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, who led the government for eight years \u2013 was able to find a solution to the fact that the dictator is buried in a giant mausoleum built by republican prisoners alongside 30,000 victims of the Civil War whose relatives do not want their remains to be there.\nFranco is Europe\u2019s only fascist leader to be buried in a grave at a landmark site that is a popular tourist attraction. The government wants the Valley of the Fallen to become a museum that will serve to explain the horrors of the dictatorship, mirroring similar initiatives in Germany and Argentina.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "10/21/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
