It is he who has been mainly responsible for making it accessible to the public.\nGeodes are cavities in the rock that are typically lined with quartz, calcite or gypsum crystals, formed quite simply from a recipe of water, minerals and lots of time.\nPulp\u00ed\u2019s is now the biggest accessible geode in the world \u2013 the largest one is in Naica in Mexico, but temperatures of 50\u00baC and a difficult location make it impossible to visit.\nAs one of the first people to show up at the old abandoned mine after the discovery of the geode within, Garc\u00eda Guinea was among those who persuaded Pulp\u00ed\u2019s mayor, Mar\u00eda Dolores Mu\u00f1oz, to take measures to prevent the translucent crystals from being plundered.\nA committee of representatives from the regional government of Andalusia, the University of Almer\u00eda, the CSIC and the local council considered several less viable and more expensive ideas to make the public aware of the site\u2019s existence, but they were finally convinced that opening it for guided tours was the most practical and desirable solution.\nWorking with a budget of \u20ac500,000, 700 tons of earth and rubble were removed from the mine to make it safe for visitors, and points of access were constructed, which was one of the biggest challenges to making the crystals a tourist attraction, according to Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Solanilla, a mining engineer and the project manager at Tecminsa, the company that carried out the work. Finally, a cast iron spiral staircase allows the public to descend the 40 meters from the main gallery into the geode itself.\nWhile there has been some concern that tours of the Pulp\u00ed mine could lead to the deterioration of the exquisitely translucent crystals within, Tecminsa geologist Francisco Javier Fern\u00e1ndez Amo insists that the risk is minimal. He says that the University of Almer\u00eda has designed a monitoring system that includes alarms if visitor numbers are exceeded, as well as sensors that control temperature, humidity and CO2 levels.\nCosting \u20ac22 per person, the group tours take a maximum of 12 visitors on a visit of a stretch of 500 meters inside Mina Rica, ending at the massive geode.\nIn the 20 years since its discovery, scientists have been confirming the crystals\u2019 uniqueness and size \u2013 at times as big as two meters \u2013 by feeding themselves into awkwardly small nooks and crannies for samples.\nFern\u00e1ndez Amo attributes a large part of the formation of the geode at Pulp\u00ed to volcanic activity that took place millions of years ago in this area. \u201cFluids filled with minerals are injected into the layers or cracks,\u201d he explains, adding that first the cavity is formed, and then the mineral deposit within it.\nThe cavity in Pulp\u00ed was possibly created by the karstification of the dolomites that form the local Aguil\u00f3n mountain range. As far as the crystals are concerned, the theory suggests a mixed karstic-hydrothermal model \u2013 in other words, the presence of gypsum and calcite reacting with the hot waters from the volcanic activity.\nIn June 2000, this newspaper published the headline \u2018Giant geode found in an Almer\u00eda mine astounds scientists.\u2019 In the story, Javier Garc\u00eda Guinea affirmed that a search of international databases had confirmed that nothing like it had previously been found.\n\u201cThe crystal prisms measuring an average of half a meter cover the entire cavity \u2013 floor, roof and walls \u2013 which is shaped like a rugby ball. They are far bigger in size than those found in the biggest accessible geodes on Earth, such as the one in the south of Brazil where the amethyst quartz geodes can measure up to a meter in diameter,\u201d he said.\nPulp\u00ed\u2019s blue geode is another element of interest, according to Fern\u00e1ndez Amo, who explains the hue is due to the presence of strontium, and that the cavity was once over 20 meters in size but was largely destroyed by the mining activities. The site was a working mine from the middle of the 19th century to the end of the 1960s, producing first iron, then silver and lead.\nNow part of the mine\u2019s attraction is those \u201cunderground cathedrals\u201d that reach a height of up to 40 meters, and the clothing worn by miners in those days, which is now on display. Other elements of note at the mine are the abundance of celestine (a variety of strontium sulfate), barite and siderite. There are also samples of lapis specularis \u2013 a transparent gypsum that was used as glass in the windows of Roman palaces.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "07/31/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
