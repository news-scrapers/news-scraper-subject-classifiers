Although beer consumption has bounced back last year after losing ground during the economic crisis \u2013 20% between 2007 and 2012 \u2013 the economic slowdown coupled with external factors such as the possibility of a no-deal Brexit have started to ring alarm bells.\nThe UK is a country with a big beer culture which doubles or triples our consumption and also helps us to export\nJacobo Olalla, managing director of Cerveceros de Espa\u00f1a\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little early to say, but we have felt the effects of the economic slowdown and then there is concrete data, such as the drop in British tourism,\u201d said Jacobo Olalla, managing director of Spain\u2019s beer producer association Cerveceros de Espa\u00f1a, during the presentation of a report on Spanish vacation habits, produced by the association.\nAccording to Olalla, Brexit is going to have a huge impact on the Spanish beer market, both in terms of tourism and exports. The United Kingdom is the third biggest export market for Spanish beer \u2013 467,132 hectoliters in 2018 from a total of 2.97 million \u2013 and the main source of foreign tourists in Spain. \u201cIt\u2019s a country with a big beer culture which doubles or triples our consumption and also helps us to export,\u201d Olalla adds.\nSummer accounts for the biggest consumption of beer in Spain. As much as 31% is drunk between June and September \u2013 the equivalent of 11 millions of hectoliters, according to Cerveceros de Espa\u00f1a. But although the British continue to choose Spain for their summer vacation, the comeback of destinations such as Turkey, as well as the growing global climate of uncertainty, are reducing their numbers; in June, 2.1 million UK tourists came to Spain, 5.3% down on the previous year.\n\u201cBrexit could have consequences for the pound [which hit its lowest exchange rate since 2017 at the end of July] and for tourism \u2013 not just holiday tourism,\u201d said Olalla, referring to the number of Brits who own a second home in Spain. \u201cA hard Brexit, which will probably limit freedom of movement, could send them home. Brexit is not good news for anyone.\u201d\nSpain is the fourth-biggest beer producer in the European Union. Last year, the sector sold more than 40 million hectoliters, more than half in bars and restaurants. According to the last report from the Ministry of Agriculture on food and drink consumption in Spain, beer is the most popular cold drink outside the home. In 2018, it accounted for 35.2% of cold drinks consumed, compared with 32.7% of water and 19.5% of soft drinks. Meanwhile, consumption within the home dropped in volume but rose 2% in value.\nBrexit is not good news for anyone\nJacobo Olalla, managing director of Cerveceros de Espa\u00f1a\nAccording to the report The Spaniards\u2019 Ideal Summer, produced by the Madison Market Research company, 70% of the 2,021 Spaniards surveyed described their ideal summer as a combination of beer and paella in a town or at the beach, accompanied by their partner in 43.7% of cases, friends in 15.6% and family in 36.2%. \u201cTourism, climate and lifestyle have made Spain the third-biggest consumer of beer,\u201d said Olalla. \u201cIt\u2019s not about consuming alcohol, it\u2019s about having a refreshing drink.\u201d\nThis would explain why Spain is one of the biggest consumers and producers of non-alcoholic beer. \u201cThe total consumption of this product is 15% of all that is drunk while in France it is just 4%,\u201d said Olalla.\nEighty percent of Spaniards associate drinking beer with an aperitif or a meal, according to the report. Rice dishes, paella and Spanish omelette are all foods that those surveyed regularly have with beer when at the beach.\nThe survey also covered favored vacation spots and found that the most popular resort is Benidorm, followed by Playa Norte in Gandia and Barceloneta. What those surveyed appreciated most about these beaches was the environment (57.6%) and cleanliness (46.3%). Among the more rural destinations, Conil de la Frontera, Llanes and Formentera were all frontrunners.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "08/14/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
