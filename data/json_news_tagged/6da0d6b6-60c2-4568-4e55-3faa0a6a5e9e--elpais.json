Quezada also planted one of Gabriel\u2019s shirts at a spot near her ex-boyfriend\u2019s house, in what the prosecution describes as an attempt to incriminate him and draw attention away from herself.\nBefore they began their deliberations, the jury received a brief from the judge in charge of the case, Alejandra Dodero, setting out instructions for answering more than 30 questions that have been put to them, according to the lawyer for the private prosecution in the case, Francisco Torres. The contents of the document were explained to the jury in open court by Dodero on Wednesday morning.\nThe jurors will now have to decide on the facts of Gabriel\u2019s death in a rural property in Rodalquilar, which Cruz and Quezada were renovating. They will decide whether Quezada committed premeditated murder, as the public prosecutor has argued, premeditated murder with malicious intent, as the private prosecution claims, or reckless or intentional homicide, which is what her defense claims.\nThe charge that she is eventually convicted of will make the difference between a jail sentence as low as three years, or the highest possible under Spanish law: permanent reviewable prison, the equivalent of life with a possibility of parole after a fixed term.\nThe public prosecutor also wants Quezada to be sentenced to an additional 10 years in prison on two counts of inflicting psychological harm on Gabriel\u2019s parents, since for 11 days after the child disappeared, there was an extensive search for him in which Quezada actively participated, making public shows of support for Gabriel\u2019s father.\nInside the jury room, the jurors will be able to review images from the trial on the DVD player and consult court testimony and reports. The task ahead of them will be long and arduous, and not likely to be resolved today.\nOn Tuesday, the last day of the hearings, the prosecution and the defense presented their closing arguments to the jury. The public prosecutor, Elena Fern\u00e1ndez, described the animosity that the defendant harbored toward her partner\u2019s child. Gabriel, she told the court, was an obstacle for the accused, and represented an emotional link between his father and mother.\n\u201cThe emotional detachment that she showed toward this child has been proven, as was similarly the case with her daughter Judith,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez told the court. That daughter was born to Quezada when the latter lived in Burgos, in northern Spain, around 20 years ago. Judith gave evidence through a video link at the Gabriel Cruz trial and testified to the difficult relationship between herself and her mother.\n\u201cShe killed him in cold blood,\u201d argued the public prosecutor, who nevertheless tried to scotch claims from the private prosecution that Quezada beat the child and then left him in distress during more than an hour before he died. For Fern\u00e1ndez, the autopsy was clear: Gabriel died in a single act from suffocation.\nThe lawyer for Gabriel\u2019s family, Francisco Torres, was as ruthless with Quezada as he had been throughout the trial. He focused on what he called her \u201cintrinsically evil,\u201d drawing attention to her lack of empathy, \u201cleaving a four-year-old child behind in Dominican Republic, coming to Spain, working as a prostitute, and then that child falls from a seventh floor.\u201d He was referring to her firstborn daughter, who died after falling out of a window in Quezada\u2019s apartment in Burgos, an incident that was treated at the time as a tragic accident but has raised further suspicions about Quezada since Gabriel\u2019s death. \u201cShe is an authentic sociopath,\u201d Torres concluded.\nQuezada\u2019s defense lawyer, Esteban Hern\u00e1ndez, closed the session with the longest arguments. He took 64 minutes to try to bolster the theory that Gabriel\u2019s death was accidental, and that the fact that she buried him in such a shallow, improvised grave proved that there was no premeditation. He claimed that Quezada covered the child\u2019s mouth to shut him up and to stop him from insulting her. When she realized the child had stopped breathing she entered into a \u201cpanic\u201d and \u201cwas completely frozen and unable to accept what had happened.\u201d\nHer defense also argued that she hid her actions given that she was unable to confess the crime to her partner, and was also under the effects of sleeping pills.\n\u201cMay God forgive me.\u201d Those were the final words of Ana Julia Quezada at her trial on Tuesday. Sobbing, she also asked for forgiveness from the family of Gabriel, \u201cmy daughter and all my family, and everyone who is feeling bad by what I did. In general, all of Spain.\u201d\nEnglish version by Simon Hunter.\n NEWSLETTER \n Sign up to EL PA\u00cdS In English Edition bulletin \nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n del 5%\nConsigue hasta un 50% de descuento\nConsigue un 10% de descuento\nAprovecha nuestro cup\u00f3n de 6\u20ac\nSi vas a contratar una hipoteca\n\u00a1No te las pierdas!\n\u00a1Desc\u00fabrelas!\nTe damos unos consejos\n\u00a1M\u00e1s por menos!\nSelecci\u00f3n de viviendas con dos plantas\nNo te pierdas nuestra selecci\u00f3n para terminar el a\u00f1o\nComedores para grandes familias\n\u00a1Lidera proyectos a nivel internacional!\n\u00a1Con 96% de descuento!\n\u00a1Escribe tu propia historia!\nExperto Universitario en Peritaje Inform\u00e1tico\nS\u00e1cale el m\u00e1ximo partido a tu voz con este curso 100% online\nFinancialo en c\u00f3modas cuotas\nCon 89% de descuento\nEstudia desde casa y a tu ritmo\nEl Valle de Zillertal es el para\u00edso de los deportes de invierno.\nValent\u00edn Dieste, nuestro experto, os acompa\u00f1a en este viaje. 1.610\u20ac/pers.\nRecorre Nueva Zelanda y los escenarios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de la saga.\nLa joya oculta del asi\u00e1tico. 2.970\u20ac/pers.\nCuyo precio en Amazon no supera los 75 euros\nPara regalar en Navidad\nM\u00e1s vendidas en Amazon\nPara personas mayores por menos de 50 euros", "date": "09/18/2019, 19:01:45", "tags": [], "newspaper": "elpais"}
